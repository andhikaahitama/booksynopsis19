<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Dom Casmurro (Library of Latin America)</h2><p>"A palm tree, seeing me troubled and divining the cause, murmured in its branches that there was nothing wrong with fifteen-year old boys getting into corners with girls of fourteen; quite the contrary, youths of that age have no other function, and corners were made for that very purpose. It was an old palm-tree, and I believed in old palm-trees even more than in old books. Birds, butterflies, a cricket trying out its summer song, all the living things of the air were of the same opinion." So begins this extraordinary love story between Bento and Capitu, childhood sweethearts who grow up next door to each other in Rio de Janeiro in the 1850s. <br> Like other great nineteenth century novels--<em>The Scarlet Letter, Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary</em>--Machado de Assis's <em>Dom Casmurro</em> explores the themes of marriage and adultery. But what distinguishes Machado's novel from the realism of its contemporaries, and what makes it such a delightful discovery for English-speaking readers, is its eccentric and wildly unpredictable narrative style. Far from creating the illusion of an orderly fictional "reality," <em>Dom Casmurro</em> is told by a narrator who is disruptively self-conscious, deeply subjective, and prone to all manner of marvelous digression. As he recounts the events of his life from the vantage of a lonely old age, Bento continually interrupts his story to reflect on the writing of it: he examines the aptness of an image or analogy, considers cutting out certain scenes before taking the manuscript to the printer, and engages in a running, and often hilarious, dialogue with the reader. "If all this seems a little emphatic, irritating reader," he says, "it's because you have never combed a girl's hair, you've never put your adolescent hands on the young head of a nymph..." But the novel is more than a performance of stylistic acrobatics. It is an ironic critique of Catholicism, in which God appears as a kind of divine accountant whose ledgers may be balanced in devious as well as pious ways. It is also a story about love and its obstacles, about deception and self-deception, and about the failure of memory to make life's beginning fit neatly into its end. First published in 1900, <em>Dom Casmurro</em> is one of the great unrecognized classics of the turn of the century by one of Brazil's greatest writers. The popularity of Machado de Assis in Latin America has never been in doubt and now, with the acclaim of such critics and writers as Susan Sontag, John Barth, and Tony Tanner, his work is finally receiving the worldwide attention it deserves.<br> Newly translated and edited by John Gledson, with an afterword by Joao Adolfo Hansen, this Library of Latin America edition is the only complete, unabridged, and annotated translation of the novel available. It offers English-speaking readers a literary genius of the rarest kind.<br></p><p>The unreliable narrator and the fictional memoir are long-standing literary traditions. Nineteenth-century Brazilian author Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis uses both to brilliant effect in his novel <i>Dom Casmurro</i>. Narrated by Bento Santiago, this memoir looks back over a life filled with the suspicion of betrayal: Bento is convinced that his wife had an affair with his best friend, and that his son was the result of it. Though he has no real evidence to support this belief, Bento becomes so obsessed with it that, in the end, he commits crimes far worse than the suspected adultery to avenge himself. The memoir itself is a kind of justification for his actions; Bento, now alone, recreates the environment of his childhood and attempts to rewrite the facts of his life--in essence, reconstructing the past. <p> Among readers familiar with Latin American literature, Machado is considered a master. His novels blend black comedy with deadly accurate social commentary and an unerring perception of human psychology to create works that are brilliant, complex without being opaque, and joys to read. The Oxford University Press edition is ably translated by John Gledson and accompanied by critical essays that will help orient readers unfamiliar with Machado's work.</p>Like other great nineteenth-century novels - The Scarlet Letter, Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary - Machado de Assis&#39;s Dom Casmurro explores the themes of marriage and adultery.

Written by Drs. Joanne Lynn and Joan Harrold and a variety of experts from nursing, hospice, counseling, and the arts, this book provides equal measures of practical information and gentle insight. Readers will learn what decisions they will need to face, where to look for help, how to ease pain and other symptoms, what to expect with specific diseases, and how the health-care system operates. Equally important to this practical information are the personal stories included here of how people have come to terms with dying, faced their fears, and made important choices.<br><br> From down-to-earth advice on how to talk to your doctor to inspiring quotes from such writers as W. H. Auden, Jane Kenyon, and others, <em>Handbook for Mortals</em> encompasses the needs of both the body and the spirit in our final years.</p><p>Written for caregivers as well as the dying, <i>Handbook for Mortals</i> is an excellent resource for anyone facing the end of life. Authors Joanne Lynn, M.D., and Joan Harrold, M.D., offer sensitive and practical advice for the ambiguous final stage of a life-threatening illness--when hope for a recovery is waning and the patient and family members are turning toward a different horizon, that of accepting and supporting an imminent death. For the most part, the authors focus on physical concerns such as pain management, artificial feeding, and an especially poignant passage about assisted suicide.<p>Because of their backgrounds, the authors are also comfortable discussing the emotional complexities of dying, such as offering advice on giving and receiving forgiveness and resolving conflicts in close relationships. (Lynn is director of the Center to Improve Care of the Dying at George Washington University and Harrold is medical director of a Pennsylvania hospice.) The handbook offers many sidebars, including "Words to Try" when speaking with a sick person: instead of saying, "Dad, you are going to be just fine," the authors suggest saying, "Dad, are there some things that worry you?" Proceeds from the sale of the book support Americans for Better Care of the Dying, a national charitable organization devoted to improving care for the last stage of life. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><br><strong>Joanne Lynn, M.D.</strong>, is Director of the RAND Center to Improve Care of the Dying and President of Americans for Better Care of the Dying. <strong>Joan Harrold, M.D.</strong>, is Medical Director of the Hospice of Lancaster County.<br></p><h2>Mathematics: A Simple Tool for Geologists</h2><p>This book is for students who did not follow mathematics through to the end of their school careers, and graduates and professionals who are looking for a refresher course. This new edition contains many new problems and also has associated spreadsheets designed to improve students' understanding. These spreadsheets can also be used to solve many of the problems students are likely to encounter during the remainder of their geological careers.<br> <p>The book aims to teach simple mathematics using geological examples to illustrate mathematical ideas. This approach emphasizes the relevance of mathematics to geology, helps to motivate the reader and gives examples of mathematical concepts in a context familiar to the reader. With an increasing use of computers and quantitative methods in all aspects of geology it is vital that geologists be seen as numerate as their colleagues in other physical sciences. The book begins by discussing basic tools such as the use of symbols to represent geological quantities and the use of scientific notation for expressing very large and very small numbers. Simple functional relationships between geological variables are then covered (for example, straight lines, polynomials, logarithms) followed by chapters on algebraic manipulations. The mid-part of the book is devoted to trigonometry (including an introduction to vectors) and statistics. The last two chapters give an introduction to differential and integral calculus. The book is prepared with a large number of worked examples and problems for the students to attempt themselves. Answers to all the questions are given at the end of the book.</p></p><p>Mathematics: A Simple Tool for Geologists is for students who did not follow mathematics through to the end of their school careers, and for graduates and professionals whose mathematics have become rusty and who are looking for a refresher course.

Run by The Prophet,&#x201d; the Settlement is a rural cooperative in alternative energy, farm produce, and locally made goods. Falsely demonized by the media as a compound of sin, the Settlement&#x2019;s true nature remains foreign to outsiders.&nbsp; It is there that Mickey meets another deserted child, six-year-old Jane, whose mother is in jail on trumped-up drug charges.&nbsp; Secret Agent&#x201d; Jane cunningly prowls the Settlement in her heart-shaped sunglasses, imagining that her plans to bring down the community will reunite her with her mother.&nbsp; As they struggle to adjust to their new, complex surrogate family, Mickey and Jane witness the mounting unrest within the Settlement&#x2019;s ranks, which soon builds to a shocking and devastating crescendo.</p><p>Carolyn Chute is the author of The Beans of Egypt, Maine; Letourneau&#x2019;s Used Auto Parts; Snow Man; and Merry Men, a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. She has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Thorton Wilder Fellowship. She currently lives in Maine with her husband.Carolyn Chute returns to Egypt, Maine, exploring the militia mentality and alternative lifestyles attractive to the poor. This powerful and disturbing story follows the consequences of attitudes and actions not at all unusual in pockets of rural poverty. Susan Ericksen&#39;s characterizations nail Chute&#39;s protagonists--from an abandoned 6-year-old to a polygamous male cult leader, his wives, and militia members of varied states of sanity and age. Unfortunately, Ericksen&#39;s inconsistent mispronunciations of common Maine names and places jolt the familiar listener and distract from her otherwise fine narration. Likewise, she imparts a heavy Parisian-French accent to speakers of the Franco-American dialect. Overall, Ericksen wisely refrains from attempting a Maine accent. A pronunciation check of proper nouns would render this performance perfect.

Using the techniques of analytic<br>philosophy to unite Marx's general statements with<br>his practice as historian and activist, Richard W. Miller<br>derives important arguments about the rational basis<br>of morality, the nature of power, and the logic of testing<br>and explanation. The book also makes Marx's theory<br>of change useful for current social science, by replacing<br>economic determinist readings with a new<br>interpretation in which systems of power relations are<br>the basis of change.</p><br><p>Part One discusses Marx's criticisms of the moral<br>point of view as a basis for social choice. The outlook<br>that emerges is humane but antimoral. Part Two argues<br>that Marx's concept of the ruling class is a means,<br>of measuring political power that is ignored yet urgently<br>needed by present-day social science. Part<br>Three bases Marx's theory of history on the<br>dynamics of power, challenging both the standard,<br>economic determinist readings of the<br>theory and standard conceptions of science.</p></p><p><p>"This book offers a subtle, highly sophisticated, fresh and unfailingly interesting interpretation of some central themes in Marx's thought. Agreeably undogmatic, it has much to interest non-Marxist moral<br>philosophers, political theorists and economists. Its aim is to elucidate some central claims of Marx in a way that will challenge non-Marxist assumptions. In this aim it admirably succeeds."<b>--Steven Lukes, Oxford University</b></p></p><h2>General William Dorsey Pender: A Military Biography</h2><p>The talented William Dorsey Pender is a prime example of the advantage held by the Confederacy in junior-level commanders during the opening months of the Civil War. The inability of the Southern forces to adequately replace Pender after his death at a young age also demonstrates the ultimate lack of depth that the Confederacy had at the command level.Pender was born in North Carolina and graduated in the top half of the West Point class of 1856. He was one of the first Southern-born officers to offer his services to the Confederacy and soon found himself a colonel, a rank he might not have attained during a full career in the pre-War army. Pender first came to prominence during the Seven Days&#39; Battles, when a number of junior Confederate officers took bold action to counter the battlefield errors of some of their better-known superiors. Pender soon developed a reputation as Robert E. Lee&#39;s favorite brigade commander.After further capable work at Antietam, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, Pender was raised to divisional command. Arriving at Gettysburg on the first day of the battle, Pender&#39;s troops from Georgia, South Carolina and his own North Carolina played a major role in driving the veteran Union I Corps from the town. Unfortunately, Pender sustained what at first seemed a minor wound later in the battle and died of complications after the Confederate retreat back to Virginia. The inability of the less-populous Confederacy to replace key figures such as Pender was an important cause of the ultimate Southern defeat.Edward G. Longacre has previously done ground-breaking research for his acclaimed biographies of John Buford, George Armstrong Custer, and Joshua Chamberlain. His study of William Dorsey Pender is both a gripping narrative and a major contribution to our understanding of Civil War principles of command.</p><p>Edward G.

Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p>This is the most complete volume published outside of Russia to capture the photographic work of Alexander Rodchenko, one of the former Soviet Union&#39;s greatest artists. In it, Alexander Lavrentiev, grandson of the photographer, includes more than 400 pictures reproduced under a broad categorical structure that allows the reader to gain insight into Rodchenko&#39;s work. What comes across most clearly from the content and form of these photos is the artist&#39;s desire to depict an image of purposeful individuality and an idealized relationship between humankind and the built world under construction in the Soviet Union. Individual portraits generally contain a device, such as a reflection, or capture some movement that obliterates the standard style of Western portraiture. Buildings, even trees, are photographed to draw attention to the space they hold rather than to depict scenic landscapes. The photos are stunningly original.</p><h2>They Built Chicago: Entrepreneurs Who Shaped a Great City&#39;s Architecture</h2><p>A story of the development of Chicago.

Its main strength lies in the Rajput schools, especially in those areas where the robust Rajput ethos and the imperial Mughul aesthetic overlapped and interfused, including a group of the animated elephant and hunting scenes from the court of Kota in Rajasthan. As a whole, the collection provides an unconventional and illuminating view of the expressive powers of Indian painters. This text, reissued to coincide with an exhibition at the British Museum, provides a complete survey and analysis of the individual works, which were selected by Howard Hodgkin himself in collaboration with Milo Cleveland Beach.</p><p></p><h2>Sources of World Societies, Volume II: Since 1450</h2><p>Designed to accompany McKay et al.&#x2019;s <i>A History of World Societies</i>, each chapter of <i>Sources of World Societies</i> contains approximately six sources that present history from the perspectives of well-known figures and ordinary individuals alike.

Did German capitalists undermine the Weimaqr Republic, finance the Nazi Party, and use their influence on behalf of Hitler's appointment to the chancellorship of Germany? <br> <br> For half a century, such charges as these have been repeatedly made, and today one of the most widely held explanations for the Third Reich's origins places prime responsibility on Germany's leading corporations. Astonishingly, this subject has never been adequately explored--and until now it was commonly believed that the records that might throw light on this important connection had been either lost or destroyed. In the pages of this groundbreaking book, Henry Ashby Turner, Jr., shows us that these records do indeed exist. And the evidence that leads him to his startling conclusion--that big business <em>did not</em>, on balance, support Hitler's political program--overthrows many of our conventional ideas about the rise of Hitler's regime. <br> <br><em>German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler</em> takes us through the major corporate archives of Weimar and Nazi Germany and inside the executive offices of the giants of Germany industry--I. G. Farben, Flick, Krupp, Siemens, and many others. It shows us the dynamics between corporations and political machines, businessmen and politicians, industrial associations and political parties. Beginning with an examination of the heritage of German big business and the role it played in the politics of the Weimar Republic, Turner scrutinizes the attitudes of the Nazi Party leadership--Hitler in particular--toward economic issues and big business. He then traces the known contacts between the Nazis and the men of big business down to the triumph of Nazism in 1933. <br> <br> For the first time, the story is told form both sides, employing documentation from Nazi as well as business sources. In the course of assessing the significance of financial contributions to Hitler's party, the author provides the first systematic analysis of Nazism's sources of income. He also gives us a new window, not only on Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, but also on the behavior of 20th-century plrivate corporations, their executives, and their influence on our times. <br></p><p></p><h2>Life and Death in the Delta: African American Narratives of Violence, Resilience, and Social Change (Palgrave Studies in Oral History)</h2><p>Terrorism, staggering poverty, and economic exploitation led to conditions of collective trauma and social suffering for thousands of black Deltans in the twentieth century.

Through oral histories, Kim Lacy Rogers provides us with an important account of the struggles and triumphs of grassroots activists and of the forces that shaped their lives. These are stories of suffering and resilience in the face of overwhelming poverty, illness, terror, and oppression, and they remind us of the sacrifice and courage that produced the civil rights movement. But these tales of sorrow and uplift also caution against an overly triumphal narrative of the civil rights struggle, providing us with a sobering reminder of how much more remains to be done in the struggle for freedom in the USA." - Nan Elizabeth Woodruff, author of American Congo: The African American</p></p><h2>Roughing It</h2><p><b>A series of sidesplitting adventures from the iconic American writer.</b><br><br>Originally published over one hundred years ago, <i>Roughing It</i> tells the (almost) true story of Mark Twain&#x2019;s rollicking adventures across the United States. A hilarious account of how the author tried finding wealth in the rocks of Nevada, it was published before his most famous works and shows why he would grow to become one of the most beloved American writers of all time.<br><br>The story follows many of Twain&#x2019;s early adventures, including a visit to Salt Lake City, gold and silver prospecting, real estate speculation, a journey to the Kingdom of Hawaii, and his beginnings as a writer. Through his attempts to strike it rich, he meets a motley crew of colorful people, while weaving through humorous mishaps and standing through it all with the endearingly good humor for which he&#x2019;s famous. The memoir showcases Twain&#x2019;s razor-sharp wit (as well as a healthy imagination), which would later become his trademark style in <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>, and <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x2019;s Court</i>.<br><br>From stagecoach travel to the etiquette of gold hunting, <i>Roughing It</i> makes a classic addition to your Mark Twain library and is a perfect example of how funny the world can be when you&#x2019;re traveling with the right person.</p><p>There is no nicer surprise for a reader than to discover that an acknowledged classic really does deliver the goods. Mark Twain's <i>Roughing It</i> is just such a book. The adventure tale is a delight from start to finish and is just as engrossing today as it was 125 years ago when it first appeared. <p> <i>Roughing It</i> tells the true-ish escapades of Twain in the American West. Although he clearly "speaks with forked tongue," <i>Roughing It</i> is informative as well as humorous. From stagecoach travel to the etiquette of prospecting, the modern reader gains considerable insight into that much-fictionalized time and place. Do you know about sagebrush, for example? </p><blockquote> Sage-brush is very fair fuel, but as a vegetable it is a distinguished failure. Nothing can abide the taste of it but the jackass and his illegitimate child, the mule. But their testimony to its nutritiousness is worth nothing, for they will eat pine knots, or anthracite coal, or brass filings, or lead pipe, or old bottles, or anything that comes handy, and then go off looking as grateful as if they had had oysters for dinner. </blockquote> <i>Roughing It</i> is informally structured around the narrator's attempts to strike it rich. He meets a motley, colorful crew in the process; many mishaps occur, and it shouldn't surprise you that Twain does not emerge a man of means. But he withstands it all in such a relentless good humor that his misfortune inspires laughter. <i>Roughing It</i> is wonderful entertainment and reminds you how funny the world can be--even its grimmer districts--when you're traveling with the right writer.12 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Vichy France and the Jews: with a new Foreword [1995] by Stanley Hoffmann</h2><p>Vichy France and the Jews: with a new Foreward [1995] by Stanley Hoffmann</p><p>&#39;This superb and definitive description of Vichy&#39;s policy...has two conspicuous merits.

It weaves together her place-Milledgeville, Georgia; her purpose-to write a good story; and her preoccupations-belief, death, grace, and the devil. I explicate the influences that give depth to her fiction: her understanding and respect for the mores of the South ( including relationships between races), the books she read and marked that reveal links to her own philosophy and literary skill, and her deep religious convictions. Today, our encounters with the other,the different one, elicit fear and lead to violence from us, as individuals and as nations. For O&#39;Connor, the otheris a distorted image of God. Her stories show how this distortion calls forth God&#39;s grace, and the violence in her stories enables her characters to discover their true selves. Her unique blend of talent and convictions allows her to create stories with long extensions of meaning. In our era of quick reads,O&#39;Connor&#39;s fiction leads us to a more contemplative mode of reading. When we finish one of her stories, we have experienced the intellectual pleasure of a finely-wrought artifact, and we also have much to think about: belief, death, grace, and the devil.

In <i>When Giants Stumble: Classic Business Blunders and How to Avoid Them</i>, the Hofstra University business-history professor zeroes in on 15 devastating failures that either severely damaged companies or spelled their doom. "After all, medical people study diseases in order to learn how to keep people healthy. Why not apply the same logic to the study of business blunders?" For example, in a chapter on E.J. Korvette, Sobel explains how founder Eugene Ferkauf created a discount-marketing Goliath that tallied an astounding $1 million in sales when it opened in 1948--only to spiral into bankruptcy by 1980 due to poor hiring practices, undercapitalization, and ill-planned expansion. Other companies that come under Sobel's microscope include Osborne Computer, Montgomery Ward, Pan American World Airways, Schwinn, Pabst, and the NYSE. What was common to all of these companies was that their failure was preceded by great success, which should give many of today's movers and shakers plenty to think about.

In a Freirean approach, critical teaching means inviting students to examine all subject matters in depth, not to swallow facts passively. Critical teaching asks students to question the status quo, to connect academic learning to their personal context and the larger social context. To Freire, critical thinking was a social inquiry into the historical and personal meaning of any knowledge. Thus, in memory of Paulo Freire, the essays in this collection report critical practices by teachers committed to transformation in and beyond the classroom.</p><p>These teachers' ingenuity produced cross-cultural stories of what can be done with some risk and experimentation. Perhaps most of all, they show culturally diverse educators constructively taking sides and refusing to fit students or themselves quietly into the status quo. Honoring the legacy of Paulo Freire, these teacher-authors carry forward Freire's dream of making the world less cruel, and transforming education into cultural action for freedom, bringing the future to life in what we do today.</p></p><p>IRA SHOR has a dual appointment as Professor of English at the City University of New York Graduate School and at the College of Staten Island.

Because its flexibility provided a forum for his dramatic imagination, Jonson was able to resolve and transcend the satiric vision that was in many ways the substance of his drama. He instructed as well as applauded his courtly audience and, with the aid of the great theatrical designer Inigo Jones, brought unity to the diverse elements of the masque, infusing them with a moral and poetic life. <br>In early 1969, Yale University Press published <i>The Complete Masques</i>, the first one-volume edition and the most carefully edited and annotated text available. A modernized version, the 576 page <i>Complete Masques </i>includes the faithful reprinting of Jonson&#x2019;s own glosses and notes, translated and annotated, as well as explanatory notes which offer the most detailed critical commentary ever undertaken.

Five years later, a Swiss patent clerk, Albert Einstein, proposed that the radiation itself must exist as quanta. Thus was born a new age in physics &#x2014; the age of the quantum &#x2014; in which some of the most basic assumptions of classical physics were swept away, and a magnificent new theoretical structure created.<br>This new physics was steeped in higher mathematics. Its concepts were often in contradiction with common sense. It rapidly became increasingly abstract and complex, to such an extent that even those well versed in classical physics were often unable to follow its labyrinthine turns and twists. How then could the layman understand it?<br>This book answers that question. By means of analogies, examples, and imaginative insights, it acquaints the layman with the historical development and basic meaning of such momentous theories and discoveries as Bohr's energy levels of the atom, Pauli's exclusion principle, de Broglie's wave theory, Bohr's correspondence principle. Schroedinger's wave equation, Heinsenberg's uncertainty principle, Dirac's fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, Sommerfeld's fine structure theory, Feynman's world lines, electron spin, invariance, the quantum number, and numerous other concepts that so drastically changed our notion of the universe. A long postscript, written especially for this edition, brings the reader abreast of events to 1958. <br>"Of the books attempting an account of the history and contents of modern atomic physics which have come to my attention, this is the best. The captivating beauty of its prose, the ingenuity of its organization and the peculiar adequacy of its analogies entitle a reviewer of this book to such luxurious praise." &#x2014; Henry Margenau, Professor of Physics, Yale University.</p></p><p>Banesh Hoffmann (1906-86) received his PhD from Princeton University. At Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, he collaborated with Albert Einstein and Leopold Infeld on the classic paper "Gravitational Equations and the Problem of Motion." Hoffmann taught at Queens College for more than 40 years. <p><b>Banesh Hoffmann: Strange But True <br></b>Though Banesh Hoffmann spent most of his teaching career at Queens College in New York, as a young man he worked with Albert Einstein and other members of the Einstein generation at Princeton, and so he was ideally situated to make the attempt to explain quantum theory to the layman. First published in 1947, the first edition of Hoffmann's book carried the unwieldy subtitle, "An Account for the General Reader of the Growth of the Ideas Underlying our Present Atomic Knowledge." Continuously in print since it first appeared, the book &#x2015; along with George Gamow's <i>Thirty Years That Shook Physics,</i> also long a Dover book &#x2015; seems to have mostly succeeded. In any case, almost every reader could at least derive some enjoyment from passages such as the one above. At Dover we were privileged to enjoy Professor Hoffmann's urbane and witty conversation directly as he often visited us into the 1980s while serving as an occasional advisor and consultant. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>From the Book:<br></b>"It did not cause anxiety that Maxwell's equations did not apply to gravitation, since nobody expected to find any link between electricity and gravitation at that particular level. But now physics was faced with an entirely new situation. The same entity, light, was at once a wave and a particle. How could one possibly imagine its proper size and shape? To produce interference it must be spread out, but to bounce off electrons it must be minutely localized. This was a fundamental dilemma, and the stalemate in the wave-photon battle meant that it must remain an enigma to trouble the soul of every true physicist. It was intolerable that light should be two such contradictory things. It was against all the ideals and traditions of science to harbor such an unresolved dualism gnawing at its vital parts. Yet the evidence on either side could not be denied, and much water was to flow beneath the bridges before a way out of the quandary was to be found. The way out came as a result of a brilliant counterattack initiated by the wave theory, but to tell of this now would spoil the whole story. It is well that the reader should appreciate through personal experience the agony of the physicists of the period. They could but make the best of it, and went around with woebegone faces sadly complaining that on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays they must look on light as a wave; on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, as a particle.

Dr. Mallove holds advanced degrees in astronautical engineering and environmental science.Mallove, a professional science writer, tells the history of recent cold fusion research from the dramatic Pons-Fleischmann announcement in March 1989 until approximately the fall of 1990. All the major twists and turns of the story are related with a modest amount of technical detail; it should be quite intelligible to laypeople. Mallove covers much the same ground at about the same level as Frank Close does in Too Hot To Handle ( LJ 5/15/91). However, there is a dramatic difference--Mallove is a firm believer in the cold fusion phenomenon; he is thus at the opposite end of the spectrum from Close. At the moment, the scientific consensus appears to be with the skeptics, but Mallove's book is nevertheless recommended for all libraries that have Close's. In tandem, the two volumes will give readers an interesting view of a continuing scientific controversy.<br><i>- Jack W.

With this startling, bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first sentence, Kafka begins his masterpiece, <i>The Metamorphosis</i>. It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetlelike insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing -- though absurdly comic -- meditation on human feelings of inadequecy, guilt, and isolation, <i>The Metamorphosis</i> has taken its place as one of the mosst widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction.

Whether it's the folkies of Greenwich Village, the student movement of the 1960s and 1970s, Born Again Christians, the Chabad Lubavitch community, or English Department postmodernists, specific intellectual and sociopolitical groups have repeatedly claimed Bob Dylan as their spokesperson. But in the words of filmmaker Todd Haynes, who cast six actors to depict different facets of Dylan's life and artistic personae in his 2009 film <em>I'm Not There,</em> "The minute you try to grab hold of Dylan, he's no longer where he was."<br><br>In <em>Light Come Shining</em>, writer Andrew McCarron uses psychological tools to examine three major turning points - or transformations - in Bob Dylan's life: the aftermath of his 1966 motorcycle "accident," his Born Again conversion in 1978, and his recommitment to songwriting and performing in 1987. With fascinating insight, McCarron reveals how a common script undergirds Dylan's self-explanations of these changes; and, at the heart of this script, illuminates a fascinating story of spiritual death and rebirth that has captivated us all for generations.<br></p><p><br><strong>Andrew McCarron</strong> is a teacher and writer born and raised in the Hudson River Valley.

At the novel&#x2019;s heart is Isabella Linwood, a bright and independent young woman who will transform from a proud Tory to ardent Rebel, challenging not only British rule but its accepted social, economic, and political institutions, including the aristocracy, slavery, and patriarchal authority.</p><p>This Legacy Edition features a lush design and French flaps.</p></p><p><p><em>The epic tale of two families wrestling with questions of loyalty, liberty, and love during the American Revolution</em></p><p>At the dawn of the American Revolution, young Isabella Linwood is poised to marry a well-to-do English nobleman. Meanwhile her true love, Eliot Lee, has just joined George Washington's army. In Catharine Maria Sedgwick's classic tale of two families torn apart by war, the loyalist Linwoods and revolutionary Lees must reckon with their beliefs and desires in a young republic still defining itself. Over the course of her conversion from proud Tory to ardent rebel, Isabella fosters a growing sense of independence, systematically questioning the institutions taken for granted all around her&#x2014;from colonialism to slavery, patriarchy to aristocracy. Will her rebellious behavior free her from society's shackles, or only confirm the power of the status quo?</p><p>Catharine Maria Sedgwick was born to a prominent New England family in 1789 and went on to become one of the most celebrated novelists of her time. A proud patriot, Sedgwick chronicled the major social issues of early American society&#x2014;slavery, religious freedom, women's rights, and the ongoing struggle between native and foreign forces&#x2014;with a unique mix of radical and conservative perspectives. She died in 1867.</p><br><br><p>Margot Livesey<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is the <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author of the novels <em>The Flight of Gemma Hardy</em>, <em>The House on Fortune Street</em>, <em>Banishing Verona</em>, <em>Eva Moves the Furniture</em>, <em>The Missing World</em>, <em>Criminals</em>, and <em>Homework</em>.

He visits the places where his brother lived and worked and introduces the people he knew and loved, Leo Tolstoy and Piotr Tchaikovsky among them. As a unique eyewitness to the beloved writer&#39;s formative years and his artistic maturity, Mikhail Chekhov shows here first-hand the events that inspired the plots for The Seagull, The Black Monk, and The Steppe, among other enduring works. Captivating, surprising, and a joy to read, this memoir reveals the remarkable life of one the most masterful storytellers of our time.</p><p><p><b>Mikhail Chekhov</b> (1865-1936) was a writer and novelist in his own right, as well as Anton's assistant and secretary. His role as his brother's biographer began in 1905 when he was asked to share his recollections in a Moscow magazine. Mikhail died in Yalta in 1936 at the age of 71. </p><p><b>Eugene Alper</b> has been a translator for over twenty years and his work includes five major plays by Anton Chekhov (with Professor Carl Mueller), a memoir about Anton Chekhov (by Isaak Altshuller), and movie scripts and interviews for Paramount and Universal.</p><p>&#x201c;A gripping study of Chekhov by his sibling...It offers a matchless eyewitness view of a man remarkable not just for literary genius but heroic decency.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Sunday Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;First published in 1933 and much referred to as source material in more formal biographies (such as those by David Magarshack, Philip Callow and Rosamund Bartlett), "Anton Chekhov: A Brother's Memoir" now finally has been translated into English, and it is rich in remembered details: who visited the family when, who drank what where, who tilled which field and gave which speech and made how many rubles and kopecks with which publication. Mikhail Chekhov remembers everything.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Offering gem after gem, this volume joins other biographical observations that contribute to the Chekhovian mythology.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Choice</i></p><p>&#x201c;There are memorable images that give us a taste of what a frisky, playful prankster Anton was before TB struck him down. He once went fishing with a friend in formal tails and top hat; he startled another sleeping friend with a flashlight in the face; he kept a pet mongoose that alarmed visitors.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>&#x201c;Mikhail writes about his brother with a warmth, clarity, and intimacy that only a brother can capture.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;This wonderful translation (by Eugene Alper) of a hundred-year-oldbiography by Anton Pavlovich's younger brother, secretary and assistant, offers uncommon first-hand insight into family dynamics and history as well as background on some of Chekhov's literary works. But the perspective of a sibling, the brother of a famous man, is intriguing enough in its own right, and one cannot help grazing this fertile biography in search of telling asides and tender criticisms, which areplentiful. It helps that Mikhail has something of his brother's cutting eye for detail, and that he does not stint on his opinions, be iton an ill-chosen summer cottage or on "The Beautiful Lika" who long sought the writer's affection.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Russian Life</i></p><p>&#x201c;Provides a sense of Anton's life that the other books cannot.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Buffalo News</i></p><p>&#x201c;It is wonderful to have this memoir finally translated into English. It provides a fascinating and absorbing portrait of Anton Chekhov and his circle. Mikhail Chekhov's voice has the uniquely compelling ring of authenticity.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>William Boyd, award-winning author of A Good Man in Africa, Restless, and the forthcoming Ordinary Thunderstorms</i></p><p>&#x201c;As a writer himself, Mikhail Chekhov often found it hard to be the &#x2018;brother of his brother'...This unpretentious and warm-hearted eye-witness account is indispensable reading for anyone wishing to acquire a vivid picture of Chekhov's remarkable life as it unfolded.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Rosamund Bartlett, author of Chekhov: Scenes From a Life and translator of About Love and Other Stories and Chekhov: A Life in Letters</i></p></p><h2>Medical-Surgical Nursing - 2-Volume Set: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems (Medical- Surgical Nursing (Lewis) 2 Vol Set)</h2><p><p>Over the past three decades, more and more nursing educators have turned to Lewis: Medical-Surgical Nursing for its accurate and up-to-date coverage of the latest trends, hot topics, and clinical developments in the field of medical-surgical nursing &#x2015; and the new ninth edition is no exception!

(Problem: your top-of-the-line dictionary mentions chaos theory not at all.) Half the battle to be an intelligent person (and to lead your children in that direction) is to be curious about the world and to ask questions; the other half is knowing where to find the right answers. And one of the best places to find answers is a good home encyclopedia. <br> Now, with Oxford's <em>Family Encyclopedia</em>, you have the most up-to-date, affordable, convenient, and appealing one-volume encyclopedia on the market--and the first such encyclopedia designed specifically for family use. Here is, first of all, the kind of readable but authoritative reference work for which Oxford is justly acclaimed, offering over 15,000 alphabetically arranged entries that put a world of information at your fingertips. There are numerous biographical entries--well over 3,000 in all--that cover artists, writers, and composers; military, political, and world leaders; religious and business figures; scientists and inventors, and much more. Readers will find concise entries on geographical places--from mountains, rivers, and seas to cities, regions, and nations (each nation entry includes a special box with map, flag, and information on the country's history, economy, geographical makeup, and political system). Science is perhaps the biggest category covered, encompassing physics, astronomy, chemistry, the environment, mathematics, the life sciences--including many entries on animals, plants, and minerals--plus hundreds of entries on technology (inventions, machine parts, and so on). There are literary terms, artistic movements, architectural styles, musical periods. Religion and mythology, medicine and health, sports and entertainment, politics and the law. Virtually any topic you would want information on you will find here. <br> Moreover, the <em>Encyclopedia</em> is packed with 1,500 color illustrations, far more color pictures than any other one-volume encyclopedia on the market, creating an eye-catching page-layout that stimulates the mind. It is the first such encyclopedia to rival CD-ROM encyclopedias for graphic quality. And these illustrations are not merely decorative. Each features a caption that either explains the picture or provides additional information on the topic. An illustration for geological faults, for instance, not only depicts tear faults, reverse faults, Horst faults, and rift faults, but also explains how each fault is formed. And the illustration accompanying the entry on the fig, far from the typical "diagram of plant parts," illustrates instead the symbiotic relationship the fig tree has with the fig wasp, revealing how the tree and insect need each other to reproduce. This colorful format will appeal especially to children, whether you are using the book to show a kindergartner what a flying squirrel looks like, or whether a middle or high school student uses it to look up information on Belarus. Other one-volume encyclopedias available offer small black-and-white illustrations every second or third page, a format that can be daunting to younger readers, who cringe at page after page of type without relief. The <em>Encyclopedia</em>'s appealing pages will engage young minds--and re-educate them about what a reference book can be. <br> Attractive and informative, the volume also offers ease of convenience. Big, multi-volume encyclopedias are unwieldy, both for children to use and for families to shelve. And CD-ROM encyclopedias must be used on the computer, which is not always in the family room. The <em>Encyclopedia</em> is easy to keep in a convenient place--on a desk, on the kitchen counter, on the home entertainment center. When a reference volume sits within an arm's reach, people are more likely to use it. And finally, at forty-five dollars, the <em>Encyclopedia</em> is a great bargain. Indeed, it is so inexpensive that families who already have multivolume or CD encyclopedias will want to purchase the <em>Encyclopedia</em> as a second, ready reference work. <br> Wide-ranging, authoritative, portable, affordable, and beautifully illustrated, Oxford's <em>Family Encyclopedia</em> will be the mainstay of your home library. When your curiosity is aroused and you have a question about the world around you, it will be the place you look to find the answer.</p><p>Settle those Jeopardy battles, do homework, or use this lovely encyclopedia to look up that pesky fact your brain refuses to retrieve. Illustrated with the usual high Oxford quality, clearly written, and loaded with special biography and topic features (including 3,000 biographical profiles), <i>The Family Encyclopedia</i> is a one-volume wonder. Kids ages 8 and older will like its size and heft--just enough to feel substantial, but never daunting.<i>Oxford Family Encyclopedia</i> (OFE) is a clearly written, one-volume encyclopedia with 15,000 entries and 1,500 full-color illustrations, including maps and drawings. It has been "designed specifically for family use."<p>OFE has more than 30,000 cross-references, indicated in small caps. Sixteen appendix pages provide tables on the earth, countries, science and numbers, world leaders, sports statistics, signs and symbols, and miscellany such as U.S. military officer ranks. The order of articles is letter by letter, but <i>Mc</i> is treated as <i>Mac</i> and abbreviations as if spelled out in full--for example <i>St</i>. is treated as <i>Saint</i>. Articles using the same main heading follow the hierarchy of people, places, and things. Popes, emperors, and monarchs with the same name are grouped by country and then chronologically. The pinyin system of transliteration for Chinese names is generally followed. In science articles, U.S. usage comes first.</p><p>Entries range in length from two sentences (<i>Alamo</i>) to a half page or more (<i>American literature)</i>.<i> </i>Countries are given at least a half a page; each has a location device, a detailed small map, flag, and salient forces such as climate, vegetation, history and politics, and the economy. Language(s) spoken, currency, ethnic groups, type of government, and religion are provided in an accompanying box. Continental maps are very basic. Current topics range from the end of the Mobutu regime in Zaire in May_ 1997 to Steven Spielberg. Some items get short shrift; <i>Gettysburg</i>, <i>Battle of,</i> for example, gets 3 sentences, while Saddam Hussein gets 10. Overall, the articles on computers are current, but <i>computer virus</i> implies that free software is the sole cause.</p><p>Wide-ranging, succinct, and sturdily bound, <i>OFE</i> is a bargain at $45. Although the multivolume <i>Oxford Children's Encyclopedia</i> may be a better size and level for a children's collection, it is now seven years old, and some upper-elementary students will want more than it offers. <i>Concise Columbia Encyclopedia</i> is more scholarly and has few illustrations. Although <i>OFE</i> is being marketed as the first one-volume encyclopedia "to rival CD-ROM encyclopedias for graphic quality," it will not replace <i>Encarta </i>in the hearts of technically oriented students. But if the computer is down--or even if it isn't^-this would be a valuable quick-reference source for students ages 10 and up and for many adults.

This unique anthology addresses the aesthetic and historical debates surrounding auteurship while providing author criticism and analysis in practice.The book draws on a wide variety of sources to highlight the major debates, criticisms, and analyses of traditional auteur theory and authorship in cinema. For the first time, classic and lesser-known film reviews are gathered in one convenient student volume. Francois Truffaut, Andre Bazin, Andrew Sarris, Pauline Kael, Peter Wollen, and Robin Wood are among the critics featured. The lifetime cinematic achievements of established directors such as John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Douglas Sirk, Frank Capra, Kathryn Bigelow, and Spike Lee are examined.The essays are organized chronologically, except in cases where flexibility adds an important historical or practical dimension. The book is an ideal resource for use in courses on authorship in the cinema, auteur theory, film theory, film criticism, film aesthetics and history of film.<b>Barry Keith Grant</b> is Professor of Communication, Popular Culture, and Film at Brock University.

Veblen's analysis of the evolutionary process sees greed as the overriding motive in the modern economy, and with an impartial gaze he examines the human cost paid when social institutions exploit the consumption of unessential goods for the sake of personal profit. Fashion, beauty, animals, sports, the home, the clergy, scholars--all are assessed for their true usefulness and found wanting. Indeed, Veblen's critique covers all aspects of modern life from dress, class, the position of women, home decoration, industry, business, and sport, to religion, scholarship, and education. The targets of Veblen's coruscating satire are as evident today as they were a century ago, and his book still has the power to shock and enlighten. Martha Banta's introduction illuminates Veblen's uncompromising arguments as it highlights the literary force of Veblen's writing and its influence on later American writers such as Edith Wharton, Henry James, Dos Passos, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. She also sheds light on his critique of the plight of women and his evolutionary arguments as they relate to modern society.</p><p><br><strong>Martha Banta</strong> is Distinguished Professor of English Emeritus at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Cox develops and demonstrates that probability theory is the only theory of inductive inference that abides by logical consistency. Cox does so through a functional derivation of probability theory as the unique extension of Boolean Algebra thereby establishing, for the first time, the legitimacy of probability theory as formalized by Laplace in the 18th century. Perhaps the most significant consequence of Cox's work is that probability represents a subjective degree of plausible belief relative to a particular system but is a theory that applies universally and objectively across any system making inferences based on an incomplete state of knowledge. Cox goes well beyond this amazing conceptual advancement, however, and begins to formulate a theory of logical questions through his consideration of systems of assertions&#x2014;a theory that he more fully developed some years later. Although Cox's contributions to probability are acknowledged and have recently gained worldwide recognition, the significance of his work regarding logical questions is virtually unknown. The contributions of Richard Cox to logic and inductive reasoning may eventually be seen to be the most significant since Aristotle.</p><p>"[This book] is, in my opinion one of the most important ever written on the foundations of probability theory, and the greatest advance in the conceptual, as opposed to the purely mathematical, formulation of the theory since Laplace."&#x2014;E.

Throughout the 1960s, during the transition from Pop art to Minimalism and Conceptualism, and up until her self-imposed exile in the 1970s, Lozano created a genuinely radical and frequently obscene body of work that traversed a gamut of idioms. Her early paintings were executed in a messy cartoon style, oozing with violence and sexuality. By 1967, Lozano was responding to Minimalism and Op art with her abstract <i>Wave </i>paintings. It was also around this time that she initiated a series of actions that tested both the limits of art and acceptable conduct in society, such as smoking pot, masturbating and, mostly notoriously of all, boycotting women. This publication accompanies a retrospective of Lozano's works at Moderna Museet in Stockholm--works which after 40 years remain as witty, acerbic and shockingly fresh as ever.</p><p></p><h2>Shakespeare&#39;s Richard III (Cliffs Notes) (CliffsNotes on Literature)</h2><p>Richard of Gloucester crosses and double-crosses friends and foes alike in a no-holds-barred effort to solidify control of the throne once occupied by his brother, Edward IV.

Tsiang (1899 -1971) (author of <em>The Hanging on Union Square</em>), takes place in a 1930s New York defined as much by chance encounters as by economic inequalities and corruption. Combining the pointed, political brevity of Gertrude Stein with his very own characteristic humor, Tsiang shows us the world of 1930s New York through the eyes of Wan&#x2013;Lee Wong, a newly arrived, nearly penniless Chinese immigrant everyman.<br> <br> Written with a poignant simplicity that mirrors Wong's own alienation in a foreign land, this unusually intimate portrait of coming to race and class consciousness, set against the backdrop of the Great Depression, illuminates the challenges endured by generations of Chinese who tried to assimilate into an alien culture, pining in utter obscurity for their homeland.</p><p>Poet, playwright, and novelist Hsi Tseng Tsiang (H. T. Tsiang) was born in China in 1899 and came to America as a young man. He was involved with the Greenwich Village literary scene in the 1920s and 1930s, and self&#x2013;published a number of books which he would hawk at downtown political meetings. Tsiang also appeared as an actor in Hollywood, most notably in the film <em>Tokyo Rose</em>. He died in 1971 in Los Angeles, CA.</p><h2>The Middle East (Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Volume 6)</h2><p>Expert writers present the major traditions of North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia, together with personal accounts of performers, composers, teachers, and ceremonies. A special feature of this volume is the inclusion of dozens of brief snap-shot essays that offer &#34;lifestories&#34; of typical musicmakers and their art, as well as first-person descriptions of specific music performances and events. Also includes maps and music examples.</p><p><strong>Virginia Danielson</strong> is Eda Kuhn Loeb Music Librarian at Harvard University and author of <em>The Voice of Egypt: Umm</em> <em>Kulthum, Arabic Song, and Egyptian Society in the</em> <em>Twentieth Century</em> (1997). <strong>Scott Marcus</strong> is Associate Professor of Music at the UC Santa Barbara. <strong>Dwight</strong> <strong>Reynolds</strong> is Professor of Religion at UC Santa Barbara and author of <em>Heroic Poets, Heroic Heroes: The Ethnography of</em> <em>Performance in an Arabic Oral Epic Tradition</em> (1995).With the current world focus on Islamic nations and culture, the appearance of the sixth volume of Garland's celebrated series of world music studies could hardly be timelier. Western Europe's musical traditions are probably more deeply rooted in ancient Semitic cultures than in Greek and Roman ones, and readers with an interest in Western music history should welcome the essays covering historical writings on Arab music. Mainly, the book focuses on contemporary music cultures, most of which have only recently been studied systematically and have not been extensively described in Western languages before. There are some articles on nations (e.g., Turkey, Iran, Israel), but most of the approximately 120 main entries cover broad geographic areas (the Arabian peninsula, North Africa, Central Asia), and readers must use the index to find mention of Afghanistan and Iraq, for example. Entries range widely from Middle Eastern melody and music in religious expression to Berber popular music, women's music in the Arabian peninsula, and music of the Jews of Djerba, Tunisia. In contrast, the seventh volume in this series, on East Asia, attempts a one-volume summary of music that has enjoyed a vast amount of scholarship in many languages as well as self-aware cultural chronicling, though for mainly political reasons, results of modern ethnomusicological explorations in China and North Korea have not yet reached a wide audience in the West. The 76 articles cover not just music but its relation to history, theater, dance, and the visual arts, with topics ranging from Chinese opera, gagaku, and Confucian ritual music to cultural interaction in East and inner Asia and nationalism, Westernism, and modernization. Both volumes contain articles on music from Tuva, an autonomous republic of the Russian Federation overlapping Siberia and Mongolia that is famed for its "throat singers." In addition, both treat popular music, but the Far East volume deals more with Western music influences on both popular and concert music in that region. Like other volumes in the series (e.g., Europe and South Asia, both LJ 6/1/00), these books are collaborative efforts, with dozens of contributors and multiple editors with diverse backgrounds (e.g., Danielson is Eda Kuhn Loeb Music Librarian at Harvard University, and ethnomusicologist Provine teaches at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, Univ. of Maryland, College Park). The factual presentations are variously straightforward ("The Armenian nation, its language, and its music originated in the third millennium B.C.E.") and engaging ("Korea is filled with singers"), and though many of the writers have scholarly backgrounds, some are evidently eyewitnesses of the tourist variety. Still, when for religious or political reasons a culture cannot be formally lived in and studied, we must be grateful for the observant amateur who attends a wedding, funeral, or concert and is willing to report. Highly recommended for large libraries and specialized collections on these geographic areas.

By delving into lives that would otherwise go unremarked, Kelly documents the modernization of the sex industry during the neoliberal era in the city of Tuxtla Guti�rrez and illustrates how state-regulated sex became part of a broader effort by government officials to bring modernity to Chiapas, one of Mexico&#39;s poorest and most conflicted states. Kelly&#39;s innovative approach locates prostitution in a political-economic context by treating it as work. Most valuably, she conveys her analysis through vivid portraits of the lives of the sex workers themselves and shows how the women involved are neither victims nor heroines.</p><p>&#x201c;This exceptional book makes several key contributions to the field and shows how freedom and anxiety, and the market and morality, tensely coexist in the business of sex. . . .

Yet most Indigenous education still takes place within a theoretical framework based in Eurocentric thought. <i>Teaching Each Other </i>provides an alternative framework for teachers working with Indigenous students &#x2013; one that moves beyond merely acknowledging Indigenous culture to one that actually strengthens Indigenous identity. Drawing on Nehinuw (Cree) concepts such as kiskinaumatowin, or "teaching each other," Goulet and Goulet demonstrate how teachers and students can become partners in education. They provide a template for educators anywhere who want to engage with students whose culture is different from that of the mainstream.</p><p>Finally, a culturally based and practical model for Indigenous education that can be applied by any teacher, anywhere.<b>Linda M.

The Sartoris family--whose saga made for some of Faulkner's finest fiction--has had its ancestry traced by Jay Martel to "the primordial Sartorisaurus and its scalyno comma/pk ill-fated broods of Sartorisauruses." And Sam Staggs satirizes Faulkner's sometimes exuberant verbosity in "As I Lay Dieting." Those are just some of the myriad indignities the author suffers in these perversely inventive parodies from American Way magazine and Faulkner Newsletter' s faux Faulkner contest, which read like an entertainingly cracked set of Cliff's Notes. The volume also includes earlier faux Faulkner, such as Kenneth Tynan's parody of "that old diurnal round of sufferin' and expiatin' and spoutin' sentences two pages long" of Faulkner's characters. As if to prove old Bill was not above a laugh at his own expense, Wells--Faulkner's niece and editor of Faulkner Newsletter --reprints his self-parody "Afternoon of a Cow," which, due to self-consciousness perhaps, never quite achieves the impish charm of the volume's other satires.

Gonz�lez-Crussi presents a brief yet authoritative five-hundred-year history of the science, the philosophy, and the controversies of modern medicine. While this illuminating work mainly explores Western medicine over the past five centuries, Gonz�lez-Crussi also describes how modern medicine&#x2019;s roots extend to both Greco-Roman antiquity and Eastern medical traditions. <br><br>Covered here in engaging detail are the birth of anatomy and the practice of dissections; the transformation of surgery from a gruesome art to a sophisticated medical specialty; a short history of infectious diseases; the evolution of the diagnostic process; advances in obstetrics and anesthesia; and modern psychiatric therapies and the challenges facing organized medicine today. Gonz�lez-Crussi&#x2019;s approach to these and other topics stems from his professed belief that the history of medicine isn&#x2019;t just a continuum of scientific achievement but is deeply influenced by the personalities of the men and women who made or implemented these breakthroughs. And, as we learn, this field&#x2019;s greatest practitioners were, like the rest of us, human beings with flaws, weaknesses, and limitations&#x2013;including some who were scoundrels.<br><br>Insightful, informed, and at times controversial in its conclusions, <i>A Short History of Medicine</i> offers an exceptional introduction to the major and many minor facets of its subject.

He lives in Chicago.If Western medicine is unique, it is because it made the body an object of systematic, scientific study. This is not stating the obvious. The human body has innumerable symbolic meanings, all emotionally charged and often contradictory. Turning it into an object of orderly inquiry and meticulous investigation was no small achievement.<br><br>It seems that for some cultures, the body hardly exists at all. Certain aborigines of New Caledonia, in the South Pacific, use the same words to name the parts of the body and the plants or other objects of their natural environment, between which they perceive a resemblance. For instance, the skin of the body and the bark of trees are designated by the same term; the identical word is used for the flesh of human limbs and the pulp of fruits; and the various inner organs share names with the produce that they outwardly resemble. In this society the body is not thought of as an independent entity but is indistinguishable from its surroundings. Similarly, in European societies during the Middle Ages and in certain communities in more recent times, alchemical notions have linked various parts of the body to the constellations of the sky: Aries &#x201c;rules&#x201d; the head; Leo, the heart; Scorpio, the genitals; and so on. The body lacks a clear border; in the elemental imagination, it merges with the rest of the cosmos. To cut or incise the body, as in anatomical dissection, would have seemed an aggression against the continuum that linked man and his environment, an attempt against the unity of the world. The impulse to study the body&#x2019;s anatomy could hardly have arisen in a society in which such concepts prevailed.<br><br>Other societies surrounded the body with religious sentiments. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, in which man was created in God&#x2019;s image, the body is a temple. Thus, it deserves solemn respect. On the other hand, the same tradition gave rise to ascetic movements in which the body was a repository of sin, a despicable, filthy thing that ought not to be made the center of an honest man&#x2019;s concerns, much less an object of serious study. Either stance was contrary to anatomical investigation. In the Middle Ages, all intellectual activity resided in the Catholic Church, but no clergyman ever distinguished himself as a surgeon or even as a barber (the profession which was then in charge of minor surgical procedures), due to the severe ecclesiastical prohibition against all forms of bloodshed.<br><br>For all their admirable medical insights, ancient India and China did not make the interior of the body the basis of their medical systems. And neither the ancient Egyptians nor the ancient Mexicans contributed anything of substance to the knowledge of anatomy. It is astonishing that the opening of innumerable human bodies in ritual practices&#x2014;the Egyptians embalmed tens of thousands of human and animal cadavers; the Aztecs sacrificed countless victims by opening the chest and extracting the heart&#x2014;should not have sparked curiosity about the structure of the organs they exposed. Yet their attitude was different: they looked at the world from a mythicoreligious perspective that was incompatible with an impersonal regard of objective reality. Thus, conceiving of the body as an autonomous object and deeming it worthy of study&#x2014;these are the signal achievements of Western medicine.<br><br>The Greeks, as is often the case in the history of Western civilization, take the palm for intellectual curiosity. Still, Hippocrates (c. 460&#x2013;c. 377 b.c.) knew very little anatomy and did not seem interested in correcting his ignorance: there is no record in the entire Corpus Hippocraticum&#x2014;his own writings and those of his followers&#x2014;of any mention of anatomical dissection. Aristotle (384&#x2013;322 b.c.) constructed a remarkable system of anatomical knowledge, all the more admirable when one reflects that he never dissected a single human body. It was entirely based on dissections of animals: birds, reptiles, mammals, and especially monkeys. But Aristotle was above all a thinker: the body was for him principally an object of metaphysical speculation.<br><br>Aristotle was a student of Plato, for whom the world of the Ideal took precedence over the more pedestrian here and now. The Aristotelian philosophical system is formidable, but when it deals with corporeal form it becomes sketchy. Aristotle, the famous Stagirite, seeks to explain the human body&#x2019;s position in the universe, how it came into being, what its origins are, and the meaning of its life. The details of bodily structure are secondary to the comprehensive nature of his metaphysics.<br><br>Two scholars of the Hellenistic civilization did perform anatomical dissections of human bodies: Herophilus (c. 335&#x2013;c. 280 b.c.) and Erasistratus of Ceos (c. 325&#x2013;250 b.c.). Both settled in Alexandria, Egypt, a great intellectual center of the ancient world, where Greek communities had long existed and which was the site of the fabled library containing more than half a million volumes, eventually destroyed in a fire. Little is known of these two men. They left no written works and are known only from references by other authors.<br><br>Herophilus was born in Chalcedon, an ancient town situated near today&#x2019;s Istanbul, Turkey. He is credited with having named the duodenum (so called because it is twelve&#x2014;duodeni&#x2014;finger breadths long) and the prostate (Greek prostates, &#x201c;standing before,&#x201d; since it is placed before the rectum); and for having determined that the arteries are full of blood, not air, as was commonly believed. This misconception may have arisen because arteries, having thick musculoelastic walls, tend to contract postmortem, so that in the cadaver they are usually empty; the blood, having been squeezed out of them, fills the veins, which have thinner, distensible walls. Herophilus also described several brain structures, including a site of cranial venous confluence that still bears his name (torcular Herophili, or &#x201c;Herophilus&#x2019;s press&#x201d;). He traced the course of nerves to their origin in the brain, thereby firmly establishing that impulses for voluntary movements travel from the brain, the site of the will and the reasoning faculty, to the extremities via the nerves, not via the arteries, as was wrongly believed.<br><br>His younger colleague and collaborator Erasistratus was born in a hamlet on the island of Ceos (or Keos) and studied in Athens. He described the cardiac valves, named the tricuspid valve, and confirmed and extended many of Herophilus&#x2019;s observations on the cranial nerves. He stuck to the belief that arteries carry air and explained the bleeding that follows their severance by proposing that the arterial walls, like all tissues, are made of tightly woven tiny veins, which promptly bleed to fill the vacuum that ensues when the artery is cut. The explanation may strike us as far-fetched, but it was perfectly in keeping with the concepts of his time. And it took genius to realize, long before the invention of the microscope, that all tissues possess innumerable small blood vessels (today we call them capillaries), aggregated into a dense network. Erasistratus imagined that the nutriment carried by these vessels poured between the spaces of the net, the parenchyma (Greek for &#x201c;something poured in beside&#x201d;).<br><br>His realization that the cardiac valves function like guards that impede retrograde flow was no less astounding, given that it came eighteen centuries before the discovery of the circulation by William Harvey (in 1628) and at a time when no valve-based propelling pump had been invented. He may be excused if his explanation of the one- way valves is part of a theoretical system that today sounds like pure nonsense.<br><br>There is a somber note that dims the glory of these two outstanding savants. Apparently, the Aristotelian idea that true knowledge of bodily structure is possible only by studying a living being prompted them to vivisect men. The kings of Alexandria, desirous of maintaining their city as a leading center of the arts and sciences, granted permission for condemned criminals to be officially surrendered to the anatomists, who then &#x201c;legally&#x201d; laid them open.<br><br>Some historians have cast doubt on the reality of that practice. If it did take place, one shudders to think what scenes of indescribable torture may have taken place in the dissection rooms of Herophilus and Erasistratus. The miserable, wretched victims were slowly cut open, their bloody, trembling organs exposed, turned over, palpated, and inspected; all amid shrieks of pain and under the cool glance of the anatomists and their pupils and assistants. Little wonder that such Christian writers as Saint Augustine and Tertullian fulminated against them and their practices, calling them ferocious beasts and bloody butchers. Again, one must place their actions in the proper historical context. The Roman Empire was on the rise. These were times when weekend family entertainment consisted of watching gladiators hack each other to death, wild animals devouring human beings, and other similar &#x201c;amusements.&#x201d; Some spectators of these &#x201c;games&#x201d; jumped into the arena, rushed over to an agonized gladiator, and drank his fresh blood or tore out a piece of his warm liver to eat in the belief that such ingestion could cure epilepsy.<br><br>After the brilliant Alexandrian period, the study of anatomy waned into the intellectual lethargy of the Middle Ages. Interest in human anatomy was briefly rekindled by the famous Galen (a.d. 129&#x2013;c. 199), who for some time held the post of physician in charge of the gladiators of the arena of his native Pergamum (today Bergama in Anatolia, present-day Turkey). In this capacity, he observed the horrible mutilations and ghastly tears that the fighters sustained, and through the gashes he certainly observed, as best he could, the conformation of the internal structures. But public opinion had changed: there was now great respect for the cadaver, and sentiment was strongly against perturbing the s...</p><h2>Publishing Manifestos: An International Anthology from Artists and Writers (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>Manifestos by artists, authors, editors, publishers, designers, zinesters explore publishing as artistic practice.</b></p><p>Independent publishing, art publishing, publishing as artistic practice, publishing counterculture, and the zine, DIY, and POD scenes have proliferated over the last two decades. So too have art book fairs, an increasingly important venue&#x2015;or even medium&#x2015;for art. Art publishing experienced a similar boom in the 1960s and 1970s, in response to the culture's "linguistic turn." Today, art publishing confronts the internet and the avalanche of language and images that it enables. The printed book offers artists both visibility and tangibility. <i>Publishing Manifestos</i> gathers texts by artists, authors, editors, publishers, designers, zinesters, and activists to explore this rapidly expanding terrain for art practice.</p><p>The book begins in the last century, with texts by Gertrude Stein, El Lissitsky, Oswald de Andrade, and Jorge-Luis Borges. But the bulk of the contributions are from the twenty-first century, with an emphasis on diversity, including contributions from Tauba Auerbach, Mariana Castillo Deball, Ntone Edjabe, Girls Like Us, Karl Holmqvist, Temporary Services, and zubaan. Some contributors take on new forms of production and distribution; others examine the political potential of publishing and the power of collectivity inherent in bookmaking. They explore among other topics, artists' books, appropriation, conceptual writing, non-Western communities, queer identities, and post-digital publishing. Many texts are reproduced in facsimile&#x2015;including a handwritten "speculative, future-forward newspaper" from South Africa. Some are proclamatory mission statements, others are polemical self-positioning; some are playful, others explicitly push the boundaries.

Legally blind since the age of eleven, Georgina Kleege draws on her experiences to offer a detailed testimony of visual impairment&#x2015;both her own view of the world and the world&#x2019;s view of the blind. &#x201c;I hope to turn the reader&#x2019;s gaze outward, to say not only &#x2018;Here&#x2019;s what I see&#x2019; but also &#x2018;Here&#x2019;s what you see,&#x2019; to show both what&#x2019;s unique and what&#x2019;s universal,&#x201d; Kleege writes.<br>Kleege describes the negative social status of the blind, analyzes stereotypes of the blind that have been perpetuated by movies, and discusses how blindness has been portrayed in literature. She vividly conveys the visual experience of someone with severely impaired sight and explains what she can see and what she cannot (and how her inability to achieve eye contact&#x2015;in a society that prizes that form of connection&#x2015;has affected her). Finally she tells of the various ways she reads, and the freedom she felt when she stopped concealing her blindness and acquired skills, such as reading braille, as part of a new, blind identity. Without sentimentality or clich�s, Kleege offers us the opportunity to imagine life without sight.</p><p><b>Georgina Kleege</b> is a novelist, essayist, and translator. Her most recent book is the novel <i>Home for the Summer.</i> She has taught writing and literature courses at the University of Oklahoma and at The Ohio State University.<br><br>In this blend of memoir and pointed cultural criticism, novelist (Home for the Summer), essayist and translator Kleege describes how she has come to terms with being blind in a world that fears and stigmatizes blindness. In 1967, at the age of 11, she was diagnosed with macular degeneration, told there was no cure or hope of improvement and declared legally blind. So Kleege, who is able to discern some light, color, movement and form, learned to hide her impairment. In school, she memorized pages of text in anticipation of being asked to read aloud, and determined what school friends were seeing by their tone of voice. With erudition that only partially belies her fury, Kleege goes on to explore the cultural meanings of blindness, dismantling negative stereotypes about the blind, including those perpetuated by such Hollywood films as Wait Until Dark and The Paradine Case and novels such as Eden Close. She also contrasts her visual experiences with those of the fully sighted and explains how, as a writer for whom reading was central, she has developed workable reading techniques. Although she was discouraged from learning braille as a child because she had "too much sight," Kleege now considers it a useful and pleasurable supplement to recorded tapes and magnification devices. Although sometimes didactic, Kleege gives readers an enlightening look at life with marginal eyesight. Agent, Mildred Marmur. (Mar.)

Now, in <em>On the Dot</em>, Alexander and Nicholas Humez offer a wide ranging, entertaining account of this much overlooked and minuscule linguistic sign.<br> <br> The Humez brothers shed light on the dot in all its various forms. As a mark of punctuation, they show, it plays many roles--as sentence stopper, a constituent of the colon (a clause stopper), and the ellipsis (dot dot dot). In musical notation, it denotes "and a half." In computerese, it has several different functions (as in dot com, the marker between a file name and its extension, and in some slightly more arcane uses in programming languages). The dot also plays a number of roles in mathematics, including the notation of world currency (such as dollars dot cents), in Morse code (dots and dashes), and in the raised dots of Braille. And as the authors connect all these dots, they take readers on an engaging tour of the highways and byways of language, ranging from the history of the question mark and its lesser known offshoots the <em>point d'ironie</em> and the interrobang, to acronyms and backronyms, power point bullets and asterisks, emoticons and the "at-sign." <br> <br> Playful, wide-ranging, and delightfully informative, <em>On the Dot</em> reveals how thoroughly the dot is embedded in our everyday world of words and ideas, acquiring a power inversely proportional to its diminutive size.<br></p><p><br><strong>Alexander Humez</strong> has authored or co-authored ten trade and reference books, including collaborations with his brother such as <em>Latin for People, Alpha to Omega, A B C Et Cetera</em>, and <em>Zero to Lazy Eight</em> (also with J. Maguire). He lives in Somerville, Massachusetts.<br> <strong>Nicholas Humez</strong> is a freelance writer and silversmith. In addition to the above collaborations, he is the author of <em>Silversmithing: A Basic Manual</em>, plus four poetry chapbooks. He lives outside Cleveland, Ohio.<br><br>"An excellent history of an underexamined typographical mark." --<em>London Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"To their credit, the Humez brothers take us beyond grammar vigilantism and demonstrate that even the most common punctuation marks serve a purpose beyond grammar. They focus on the history and use of the dot and those punctuation marks where it resides (semicolons, question marks, ellipses, etc.). They delve into uses of the dot beyond punctuation, in Morse Code and musical notation and mathematical and computational punctuation." --<em>The Weekly Standard</em><p></p><br>"An engrossing collection of curiosities that rewards dipping in and out at one's leisure." --<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"In the emendations of proofreaders, the computer coding of internet engineers, the calculations of accountants, and the musical notations of composers, the Humez brothers catalogue an impressive array of meanings conveyed by the dot. The author's lively inquiries open surprising political and literary insights. Who would have guessed, in short, that a mere speck of ink could inspire such a fascinating foray?" --<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"Ideal for etymologists and trivia buffs, this book covers an array of information and innovations on the relevance of this speck, from the preDewey decimal library of Alexandria to the modern global culture of URLs, instant messaging and the music of Stevie Wonder." --<em>Publisher's Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Like its subject, the book is brief but wide ranging. This is not a straightforward history: Humez and Humez meander through etymology and culture, leaving the reader to, in effect, connect the dots. A must for academic and public libraries, this is the sort of book that can liven a class on the the history of orthography or design. Highly recommended." --<em>Choice</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Illustrated WALDEN with Photographs from the Gleason Collection (Writings of Henry D.

Contrary to the hopes of the peasants in this story, the redistribution of land does not mean an end to hunger. Man-made and natural disasters bring about the threat of famine, while China's involvement in the Korean War further deepens the peasants' misery. Chang's chilling depiction of the peasants' desperate attempts to survive both the impending famine and government abuse makes for spellbinding reading. Her critique of communism rewrites the land-reform discourse at the same time it lays bare the volatile relations between politics and literature.</p><p>"A modern Chinese classic."&#x2015;C. T.

The authors begin by systematically defining the principles of moral intelligence and the behavioral competencies associated with them. Next, they demonstrate why sustainable optimal performance&#x2013;on both an individual and organizational level&#x2013;requires the development and application of superior moral and emotional competencies. Using many new examples and real case studies and new interviews with key business leaders, they identify connections between moral intelligence and higher levels of trust, engagement, retention, and innovation. Readers will find specific guidance on moral leadership in both large organizations and entrepreneurial ventures, as well as a new, practical, step-by-step plan for measuring and strengthening every component of moral intelligence&#x2013;from integrity and responsibility to compassion and forgiveness.

Yet affirmative action and skyrocketing tuition are only the most recent dissonant issues to emerge. Recounting the many crises and triumphs in the long history of American higher education, historian John Thelin provides welcome perspective on this influential aspect of American life.</p><p>In <i>A History of American Higher Education</i>, Thelin offers a wide-ranging and engaging account of the origins and evolution of America's public and private colleges and universities, emphasizing the notion of <i>saga</i>&#x2015;the proposition that institutions are heirs to numerous historical strands and numerous attempts to address such volatile topics as institutional cost and effectiveness, admissions and access, and the character of the curriculum. Thelin draws on both official institutional histories and the informal memories that constitute legends and lore to offer a fresh interpretation of an institutional past that reaches back to the colonial era and encompasses both well-known colleges and universities and such understudied institutions as community, women's, and historically black colleges, proprietary schools, and freestanding professional colleges.</p><p>Thelin's lively history has particular relevance for a society still struggling to determine what constitutes a legitimate field of study, reminding readers that Harvard once used its medical school as a safe place to admit the sons of wealthy alumni who could not pass the undergraduate college admissions examination and that the University of Pennsylvania once considered the study of history, government, and economics unworthy of addition to the liberal arts curriculum. Thelin also addresses the role of local, state, and federal governments in colleges and universities, as well as the influence of private foundations and other organizations. And through imaginative interpretation of films, novels, and popular magazines, he illuminates the convoluted relationship between higher education and American culture. For anyone attempting to understand America's colleges and universities, <i>A History of American Higher Education</i> offers a much-needed challenge to conventional wisdom about how these institutions developed and functioned in the past.</p></p><p><p><b>John R.

He is a member of Professional Photographers of America, the North American Nature Photography Association, and Nikon Professional Services--and adheres to the ethical guidelines of those fine organizations. Darrell has been photographing people, events, and places professionally for over 30 years, with a special interest in natural history. &nbsp; His mother gave him a Brownie Hawkeye camera in 1968 at the young age of 10 years and awakened a lifelong interest in capturing slices of time. Living in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains--near Great Smoky Mountains and the Blue Ridge Parkway--has given him a real concern for the natural environment and a deep interest in nature photography. You'll often find Darrell standing behind a tripod in the beautiful mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina. &nbsp; Since about 2000 Darrell has been an active blogger and article writer on photographic subjects. In 2008 his first photography book was published and, since then, he has authored over a dozen books on the technical side of photography, with a special interest in helping new photographers fully understand their complex cameras so they can use them for more effective and enjoyable photography.</p><h2>Thomas Hirschhorn: Deleuze Monument (Afterall Books / One Work)</h2><p><p><b>An illustrated examination of one of Hirschhorn's &#x201c;precarious&#x201d; monuments, now dismantled.</b></p><p>Part-text, part-sculpture, part-architecture, part-junk heap, Thomas Hirschhorn's often monumental but precarious works offer a commentary on the spectacle of late-capitalist consumerism and the global proliferation of commodities. Made from ephemeral materials&#x2015;cardboard, foil, plastic bags, and packing tape&#x2015;that the artist describes as &#x201c;universal, economic, inclusive, and [without] any plus-value,&#x201d; these works also engage issues of justice, power, and moral responsibility. Hirschhorn (born in Switzerland in 1957) often chooses to place his work in non-art settings, saying that he wants it to &#x201c;fight for its own existence.&#x201d; In this book, Anna Dezeuze offers a generously illustrated examination of Hirschhorn's <i>Deleuze Monument</i> (2000), the second in his series of four <i>Monuments</i>.</p><p><i>Deleuze Monument</i>&#x2015;a sculpture, an altar, and a library dedicated to Gilles Deleuze&#x2015;was conceived as a work open to visitors twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Part of the exhibition &#x201c;La Beaut�&#x201d; in Avignon, Deleuze Monument was controversial from the start, and it was dismantled two months before the end of the exhibition after being vandalized. Dezeuze describes the chronology of the project, including negotiations with local residents; the dynamic between affirmation and vulnerability in Hirschhorn's work; failure and &#x201d;scatter art&#x201d; in the 1990s; participatory practices; and problems of presence, maintenance, and appearance, raised by Hirschhorn's acknowledgement of &#x201c;error&#x201d; in his discontinuous presence on site following the installation of <i>Deleuze Monument</i>.</p></p><p>Anna Dezeuze, is the editor of <i>The 'Do-it-yourself' Artwork: Participation from Fluxus to New Media</i> and co-editor, with Julia Kelly, of <i>Found Sculpture and Photography from Surrealism to Contemporary Art</i>.

While cosmopolitan politics may seem inherently secular, existing forms of secularism risk undermining the universality of cosmopolitanism because they privilege the European tradition over all others and transform particular historical norms into enunciations of truth, valid for all cultures and all epochs. In this book, the noted philosopher �tienne Balibar explores the tensions lurking at this troubled nexus in order to advance a truly democratic and emancipatory cosmopolitanism, which requires a secularization of secularism itself.<br><br>Balibar argues for the idea of the universal against its particular dominant institutions. He questions the assumptions that underlie popular ideas of secularism and religion and outlines the importance of a new critique for the contemporary world. Balibar holds that conflicts between religious and secular discourses need to be reframed from a point of view that takes into account the cultural hybridization, migration and mobility, and transformation of borders that have reshaped the postcolonial age. Among the topics discussed are the uses and misuses of the category of religion and the religious, the paradoxical genealogy of monotheism, French <i>la�cit�&#x2019;s </i>identitarian turn, and the implications of the responses to the Charlie Hebdo attacks for an extended definition of free speech. Going beyond circumscribed notions of religion and the public sphere, <i>Secularism and Cosmopolitanism</i> is a profound rethinking of identity and difference that seeks to make room for a renewed political imagination.</p><p>�tienne Balibar is emeritus professor of philosophy at Paris X Nanterre and emeritus professor of comparative literature at the University of California, Irvine. He is also professor of modern European philosophy at Kingston University, London, and professor of French and comparative literature at Columbia University. His books include <i>Violence and Civility: On the Limits of Political Philosophy</i> (Columbia, 2015).One of our best European activist philosophers here considers the question of secularism, religion, and cosmopolitanism in a broad range: Islam, the historical contradictions of secularism in the Israeli state, the implications of French <i>la�cit�</i>, the history of the term<i> </i>'monotheism' from Europe<i>an </i>antiquity, and serious considerations of gender at every step. 'Generalized heresy as philosophical fiction' is, for Balibar, our persistent, repeated, heterogeneous, and collective political task of invention. Those of us trying to work away from the Abrahamic and toward the rural subaltern electorate find in Balibar a powerful ally. (Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, author of <i>Death of a Discipline</i> and <i>Other Asias</i>)<br><br><i>Secularism and Cosmopolitanism</i> is the textual equivalent of a rich ongoing seminar with one of our most erudite, astute living philosophers. In writings spanning more than a decade, Balibar opens rather than stipulates the meanings of religion, secularism, and <i>l</i><i>a�cit�</i> as well as those of universalism and multiculturalism. From the veil controversy to the <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> bombing, from reading Jean-Jacques Rousseau to reading Joan Scott, Balibar teaches us not what to think about contemporary religious-secular conflicts in Europe, but how. (Wendy Brown, University of California, Berkeley)<br><br>Over the years �tienne Balibar has perfected a style of polemic both so ruthless and so sweet that his antagonists&#x2015;whether postsecularism or "official" secularism, whether the champions of biopolitics or of euroskepticism&#x2015;are still smiling even as their heads are separated from their bodies, and will often keep smiling as they lie lifeless on the ground. A revolutionary for our times, a revolutionary without slogans, Balibar brings all of philosophy's resources to bear on the conceptual challenges buried in today's news, and tomorrow's. The concepts he has inspected and re-thought with his signature rigor are fresh and ready for action. (Bruce Robbins, Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities, Columbia University)<br><br>�tienne Balibar has been one of the world's leading political philosophers for the last several decades and has had an enormous impact around questions concerning the relation among notions of individuality, selfhood, and state sovereignty in the modern era. <i>Secularism and Cosmopolitanism</i> is a short but trenchant book by an important thinker on a vital topic. (William Egginton, Johns Hopkins University)<br><br>Baliber&#x2019;s writing on religion and politics contains remarkable insights for scholars working on secular ethics and contemporary religious quarrels. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Balibar is therefore still an Enlightenment thinker, even if a chastened one. He sees our problems clearly and diagnoses them with vigor. (<i>Commonweal</i>)<br><br>...a vital read, both challenging and probing, and one which we can all benefit from. (Lewis George Bloodworth <i>Marx and Philosophy Review of Books</i>)</p><h2>Stochastic Processes with Applications to Finance</h2><p>In recent years, modeling financial uncertainty using stochastic processes has become increasingly important, but it is commonly perceived as requiring a deep mathematical background. Stochastic Processes with Applications to Finance shows that this is not necessarily so. It presents the theory of discrete stochastic processes and their applications in finance in an accessible treatment that strikes a balance between the abstract and the practical.<br><br>Using an approach that views sophisticated stochastic calculus as based on a simple class of discrete processes-"random walks"-the author first provides an elementary introduction to the relevant areas of real analysis and probability. He then uses random walks to explain the change of measure formula, the reflection principle, and the Kolmogorov backward equation. The Black-Scholes formula is derived as a limit of binomial model, and applications to the pricing of derivative securities are presented. Another primary focus of the book is the pricing of corporate bonds and credit derivatives, which the author explains in terms of discrete default models.<br><br>By presenting important results in discrete processes and showing how to transfer those results to their continuous counterparts, Stochastic Processes with Applications to Finance imparts an intuitive and practical understanding of the subject. This unique treatment is ideal both as a text for a graduate-level class and as a reference for researchers and practitioners in financial engineering, operations research, and mathematical and statistical finance.</p><p></p><h2>Theatre Audiences: A theory of production and reception</h2><p>Susan Bennett's highly successful <em>Theatre Audiences</em> is a unique full-length study of the audience as cultural phenomenon, which looks at both <em>theories</em> of spectatorship and the <em>practice</em> of different theatres and their audiences.<br> Published here in a brand new updated edition, <em>Theatre Audiences</em> now includes:<br> `nBL a new preface by the author<br> � a stunning extra chapter on intercultural theatre<br> � a revised up-to-date bibliography<br> <em>Theatre Audiences</em> is a must-buy for teachers and students interested in spectatorship and theatre audiences, and will be valuable reading for practitioners and others involved in the theatre.<br></p><p>Susan Bennett is Professor of English at the University of Calgary.

Bearden is best known for his paintings and collages but also made significant contributions to the fields of printmaking, theatrical design, film, and other visual formats. While acknowledging the artist's place in African-American art history, where he has received his primary recognition, the fourteen essays collected in this volume seek to establish Bearden's role within the broader framework of American modernism in political, social, philosophical, and aesthetic contexts. </p><p>These essays, written by distinguished scholars, track Bearden's cultural concerns and artistic evolution, from his early political cartoons to his important relationships with preeminent practitioners in the fields of literature, music, theater, and dance.

Alain Corbin's engaging book reveals how attitudes toward the ocean gradually began to shift from the negative to the positive, so that by the mid-1800s our present-day salubrious notion of the seashore had come into being.<br><br>Going back to ancient times, Corbin describes conceptions of the sea in relationship to how people thought and felt about their place in the world. He then shows how the Enlightenment and changing attitudes in science, literature, and art affected notions of the sea. Ocean bathing came to be seen as therapeutic, the sea was linked with the creation of life, and the shore became a locale for self-exploration and reverie. Discovery of the seaside had political, economic, and social effects, too. The shore as a place of pleasure led to the rapid growth of British coastal towns such as Brighton, followed by other resorts in Europe. All of this Corbin lays out in wonderful detail, blending history, theory, and anecdote into an absorbing whole.<br><br><i>The Lure of the Sea</i> suggests the fashioning of a modern sensibility in the West's discovery of the shore&#x2014;one that is health-conscious and intent on regeneration through vigorous contact with nature. Written by one of today's most literate and imaginative historians, it offers an inviting cultural excursion for scholars and general readers alike.</p><p>Alain Corbin&#39;s wonderful book explores the dramatic change in Western attitude towards the sea and seaside pleasures that occurred between 1750 and 1840. Interest in travel; the arrival of landscape painting, geology and natural theology; fashions in medicine and the advent of the bathing-machine; the emergence of Romanticism and the Sublime - these are only some of the elements that helped transform perceptions. By the time Jane Austen wrote Sanditon - perhaps the first &#39;seaside&#39; novel - in 1817, the sea and shore had come to be viewed as something intensely and sensuously pleasurable, with beach holidays all the rage in new resorts from Brighton and Scarborough to Dieppe.<b>Alain Corbin</b> is Professor of Modern History at the University of Paris I, Sorbonne and the author of <i>The Foul and the Fragrant</i> (1986).</p><h2>The Mutual Evolution of Earth and Humanity: Sketch of a Geology and Paleontology of the Living Earth</h2><p>This epic work by Dankmar Bosse presents, for the first time, a comprehensive picture of the evolution of the earth and its natural kingdoms, based primarily on geology and paleontology, and with reference to the results of Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s spiritual-scientific research.<br><br>&#x201c;The Evolution of the Cosmos and Humanity,&#x201d; chapter 4 of Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s fundamental work in 1910, <i>An Outline of Esoteric Science,</i>&nbsp;is the single most extensive expression of his suprasensory research into evolution as a whole.

Numerous examples are offered at every stage, all in English or 'foreignized' English.</p> <p>Although primarily written as a practitioner's explanation rather than a theorist's speculation, the book includes notes on concepts such as units of meaning, translation units and discourse structure, as well as stances on more polemical issues such as the use of omission and the ethics of interpreting mistakes. The book concludes with a comment on the pleasure of conference interpreting, as well as a glossary and suggested further readings. In all, it fills a major gap in English-language publications on interpreting, providing an introduction for beginners, a down-to-earth guide for students, and a handy compendium for teachers.</p> <p>The first edition of this book was published in the series Translation Theories explained, at a time when St. Jerome had no separate series for books on practice as such. Happily, it has now found its rightful place in the Practices series.

This exciting new first edition presents macroeconomics in the context of real world decision-making, It helps students grasp practical big picture concepts, nurtures an understanding of what causes macroeconomic variables to change, and relates these changes to issues confronting managers. Marthinsen integrates the three major macroeconomic sectors (i.e., the real goods market, real loanable funds market, and foreign exchange market) in a user-friendly way with a minimum of math and only supply and demand analysis. Liberating readers from dry, overly complex macroeconomic models, Marthinsen uses theory only as a means to an end for practical understanding. Clear and concise, the book focuses on concrete business examples to show how economic shocks, such as monetary and fiscal policies or shifts in international capital flows, affect management decisions. The book was written for MBAs who were not necessarily economics majors, making it appealing to students with a variety of undergraduate backgrounds. Marthinsen keeps readers visually engaged with strategic use of figures, tables, charts, and illustrative exhibits. MANAGING IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY offers a strategic focus, emphasizes the interaction among markets, and equips MBAs with a macroeconomic perspective that will last (and be used) for years.</p><p>Dr. John E.

Many things have changed since this book was first published in 1989, and SQL is no exception. The SQL language has expanded tremendously, both in numbers of users and in numbers of commands. Sales of relational databases continue to at a strong and steady rate. When we wrote the first edition of The Practical SQL Handbook, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) had already approved the 1986 SQL standard. The International Standards Organization (ISO) adopted it in 1987. Both ANSI and ISO helped create the 1989 version. The 1986 standards were skimpy, lacking features that most commercial vendors offered. The 1989 standards were more complete, but still left many important elements undefined. For the first edition, we felt we should focus on industry practice: as always, each vendor keeps a wary eye on what the others are doing and makes core offerings similar enough to attract both customers migrating from competitors, as well as new users looking for database systems they can build on. Because of this, we left both the not-quite-jelled ANSI standards and particular vendor implementations to the experts in those fields and concentrated on the common ground: generic or "industry-practice" SQL. Our goal was to offer the intelligent amateur practical information on how to use the actually available SQL of that time. The 1992 ANSI standard (often called SQL-2 or SQL-92) represented a new stage in SQL development. This standard was more comprehensive than the 1989 standard: in written form it contained more than four times as many pages as the earlier version. Database vendors have adopted large parts of the 1992 standard. With the widespread adoption of the SQL-92 standard, the industry practice and the ANSI/ISO standards began to converge.<p>Despite vendor-specific differences, there is a general, industry-wide core of SQL commands that all users need to understand. Adopting standards doesn't happen overnight; it is a long process. At any point, vendors will have varying levels of conformance and will continue to produce vendor-specific variations. This book aims to give SQL users a mastery of the fundamentals of the language, with a side glance at the specifics of particular implementations.</p><p>Changes for Recent Editions The changes for recent editions have been in three areas: to include more real-world examples to emphasize the SQL-92 features that most vendors have implemented to provide software for hands-on practice.</p><p>More Real-World Examples In talking to new and developing SQL users, we heard over and over of their need for more examples to follow, change, narrow, and broaden. Accordingly, the bulk of the added material in the second edition consisted of code "recipes." Chapter 11, "Solving Business Problems," is a selection of code samples based on questions and answers that came over popular computer newsgroups. We reproduce interesting problems and solutions in terms of the sample bookbiz database used throughout the book. The chapter includes examples of using the CASE function for conditional logic, formatting results, and finding date data. A few samples fall into a different category. They aren't so much solutions to problems as indications of common errors. They include issues with DISTINCT and misunderstandings of what SQL can do.</p><p>Emphasize SQL-92 With the third edition, we revised the book to incorporate the SQL-92 features that most vendors have adopted. These include new datatypes, additions to the CREATE TABLE statement that allow built-in integrity constraints, modifications to the ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses, the new escape character for the LIKE keyword, and changes to GRANT and REVOKE, among others.</p><p>Provide Software for Hands-On Practice With the fully-usable trial version of Sybase's Adaptive Server Anywhere on the CD that accompanies this book, you can run the examples (and your variants) on a PC. We've always felt that the secret to learning SQL is practice. Now you can experiment to your heart's content, trying out code samples with data you know and checking the results to see if they are what you expect. When you're stumped by complicated code, break it into small, meaningful pieces and run them separately to make sure you understand what each segment does. Then put them together in increasingly complex combinations--and have fun! The Sybase Adaptive Server Anywhere software on the CD is a 60-day full-feature version that allows you to create objects as well as query existing ones. ASA is built with an updated version of the bookbiz database: for the fourth edition, we increased book prices and made dates more recent. Also included on the CD are scripts to create the database on ASA (in case you damage the original) and on the other systems discussed in the book.</p><p>The Fourth Edition The Practical SQL Handbook fourth edition continues to focus on industry-practice SQL, but the information included is at once more general and more specific than earlier editions. For the fourth edition, we had two objectives: to expand our test base, running the examples on five different database systems to include examples showing vendor-specific differences among systems</p><p>Test on More Systems For the fourth edition, all examples were run on five systems (Sybase Adaptive Server Anywhere and Adaptive Server Enterprise, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Informix), rather than on Sybase systems only, as in the third edition. This expanded test base makes the information more universal. We are no longer limited to what we can explore or verify on a particular system. If an important feature doesn't exist on Adaptive Server Anywhere (ASA, the RDBMS included on the CD), we can show code and results from Oracle or SQL Server.</p><p>Show Examples of Vendor-Specific Differences On the other hand, this edition is more specific. It includes information on specific idiosyncrasies of the five SQL dialects, warning readers where to look for differences. In this, it reflects the real world---lots of database users are working with multiple systems, either sequentially or simultaneously. Interesting SQL differences are flagged as SQL Variants, in-text sections that show details on how single and double quotes are used by different vendors, or users added, or outer joins specified. You won't see code for every one of the five systems every time, but you'll get an introduction to the kind of differences that are likely in a particular area.</p><p>0201703092P04062001</p><p> <b>Judith S.

G. Jung regarded as one of his most gifted students, devoted much of his later writing to the theme of creativity. This is the third volume of Neumann's essays on that subject. Neumann found his examples not only in the work of writers and artists--William Blake, Goethe, Rilke, Kafka, Klee, Chagall, Picasso, Trakl--but as well in that of physicists, biologists, psychiatrists, and philosophers. Confronting the problem of portraying men and women as creative beings, Neumann expanded the concepts of Jungian psychology with a more comprehensive definition of the archetype and a new concept--"unitary reality." Whether or not humanity can be restored to health from its present situation as a self-endangered species depends, according to Neumann, on whether we can experience ourselves as truly creative, in touch with our own being and the world's being. The six essays comprising this volume--"The Psyche and the Transformation of the Reality Planes," "The Experience of the Unitary Reality," "Creative Man and the `Great Experience,'" "Man and Meaning," "Peace as the Symbol of Life," and "The Psyche as the Place of Creation"--all originated as lectures at the Eranos Conferences in the years 1952 to 1960.</p><p>Originally published in 1989.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

The <i>Concours du Grand Prix de Rome</i> was the ultimate test of ability, and thus the index of the Academy's ideals throughout this period. This book reproduces, in more than 200 drawings, projects for the Grand Prix and for virtually every other type of competition or assignment at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Included are drawings by students who subsequently became preeminent as professional architects&#x2014;among them Henri Labrouste, architect of the Biblioth�que Sainte-Genevi�ve, and Charles Garnier, architect of the Paris Op�ra. All illustrations are accompanied by extensive explanatory captions, and a selection of important larger studies appear on specially folded inserts, enabling the reader to view them in unusually clear and precise detail.<br> <br> Complementing the student work reproduced here is a selection of photographs by major Beaux-Arts buildings executed in France and the United States. In all, the book contains 423 illustrations, 23 in color, and 10 inserts.<br> <br> <i>The Architecture of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts</i> offers an enlightening analysis of the school. The authors examine Beaux-Arts concepts of theory and practice and assess major work by each of the school's main factions. The essay by Richard Chafee covers the school's complex political and administrative history and is followed by a survey of the school's evolving notions of architectural composition&#x2014;from Charles Percier through Garnier&#x2014;by David Van Zanten. Neil Levine discusses the emergence of the <i>Neo-Grec</i> and the ideas of Labrouste, which in their preoccupation with literature and meaning in architecture parallel some recent concerns. In the final essay, Arthur Drexler examines such issues as the uses of the past, the ethical implications of style versus "non-style," and the techniques of visualizing buildings that have influenced the development of modern architecture.</p><p></p><h2>Pro ASP.NET 4.5 in C#</h2><p>ASP.NET 4.5 remains Microsoft's preferred technology for creating dynamic websites, providing developers with unrivaled power and flexibility.<p> </p><p> <em>Pro ASP.NET 4.5 in C#</em> is the most complete reference to ASP.NET that you will find.

His explanation of forms ranges from the essentials of iambic pentameter to the obscurities of acronymic and grammar verse. The heart of the book is a rhyming dictionary organized phonetically by syllables into three sections: words rhyming on the last, the penultimate, and the antepenultimate syllable. Over 80,000 words are included, and though it will take a little practice to use, writers of rhyming lyrics and verse should be quite satisfied with this. The glossary conveniently defines the obscure words cited, and appendixes list further words with common endings; the index is to the first lines of Espy's illustrative verses.

To his surprise, thousands rallied to the idea, converting what he had assumed would be another of his utopian schemes into a mass political movement of extraordinary dimensions. With a loosely knit organization of hundreds of local EPIC clubs, Sinclair overwhelmed the moderate Democratic opposition to capture the primary election. When it came to the general election, however, his opposition employed highly effective campaign tactics: overwhelming media hostility, vicious red-baiting and voter intimidation, high-priced dirty tricks. The result was a resounding defeat in November.<br><br><i>I, Candidate</i> tells the story of Sinclair's campaign while also capturing the turbulent political mood of the 1930s.

Phibbs, a combat surgeon, entered the fighting in November 1944, in the battle for Alsace-Lorraine, and when his unit - Combat Command B, Twelfth Armored Division, Seventh U.S. Army - invaded Germany, it was the lead point of the southern branch of the Allied pincer. By the time they hit Ansbach, his was the Allied unit farthest east on the German Front, and they stayed on the point, fighting constantly, until the end of the war. Phibbs writes of rescuing injured men from the battlefield and of interrogating POWs and collaborators. He exposes the incompetence of the Army bureaucrats and officers whose decisions often resulted in needless deaths. And he unforgettably describes being among the first Americans to enter typhus-ravaged Dachau. Our War for the World is an account of extraordinary events, extraordinarily told.

Policymakers, educators, and the general public all want to know: Why do fundamentalist movements turn violent? Are fundamentalisms a global threat to human rights, security, and democratic forms of government? What is the future of fundamentalism?<br> <br> To answer questions like these, <i>Strong Religion</i> draws on the results of the Fundamentalism Project, a decade-long interdisciplinary study of antimodernist, antisecular militant religious movements on five continents and within seven world religious traditions. The authors of this study analyze the various social structures, cultural contexts, and political environments in which fundamentalist movements have emerged around the world, from the Islamic Hamas and Hizbullah to the Catholic and Protestant paramilitaries of Northern Ireland, and from the Moral Majority and Christian Coalition of the United States to the Sikh radicals and Hindu nationalists of India. Offering a vividly detailed portrait of the cultures that nourish such movements, <i>Strong Religion</i> opens a much-needed window onto different modes of fundamentalism and identifies the kind of historical events that can trigger them.</p></p><p><b>Gabriel A.

Sokal's main argument, then and now, is for the centrality of evidence in all matters of public debate. The original article, (included in the book, with new explanatory footnotes), exposed the faulty thinking and outright nonsense of the postmodernist critique of science, which asserts that facts, truth, evidence, even reality itself are all merely social constructs. Today, right wing politicians and industry executives are happily manipulating these basic tenents of postmodernism to obscure the scientific consensus on global warming, biological evolution, second-hand smoke, and a host of other issues. Indeed, Sokal shows that academic leftists have unwittingly abetted right wing ideologies by wrapping themselves in a relativistic fog where any belief is as valid as any other because all claims to truth must be regarded as equally suspect. Sokal's goal, throughout the book, is to expose the dangers in such thinking and to defend a scientific worldview based on respect for evidence, logic, and reasoned argument over wishful thinking, superstition, and demagoguery of any kind.<br> Written with rare lucidity, a lively wit, and a keen appreciation of the real-world consequences of sloppy thinking, <em>Beyond the Hoax</em> is essential reading for anyone concerned with the state of American culture today.</p><p><br><strong>Alan Sokal</strong> is Professor of Physics at New York University and Professor of Mathematics at University College London. He is co-author with Roberto Fernandez and Juerg Froehlich of <em>Random Walks, Critical Phenomena, and Triviality in Quantum Field Theory</em>, and co-author with Jean Bricmont of <em>Fashionable</em> <em>Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science.</em><br>In 1996, NYU physicist Sokal published a paper entitled Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity in an academic journal. Shortly thereafter, and to great furor, Sokal reported that his paper was a parody of postmodernism. This collection of 10 essays, six of which have been previously published, expands upon the central ideas of that academic joke. Sokal demands a respect for evidence and attacks postmodernists, fundamentalists and the muddle-headed of all political and apolitical stripes. The opening chapter presents the original hoax paper in its entirety, with the addition of annotations describing how he came to write it and explaining all the inside jokes. In subsequent chapters, Sokal explains how postmodernists confuse truth with claims of truth, fact with assertions of fact, and knowledge with pretensions to knowledge, and demonstrates how pseudoscientists have adopted a similar perspective. In biting prose, he analyzes the concept of therapeutic touch being promoted in nursing and Vedic science being advanced by Hindu nationalists. Though he concludes with his weakest argument&#x2014;that religion is simply another form of pseudoscience&#x2014;Sokal consistently asks the reader to think clearly and follow the evidence, regardless of where it may lead, and for that alone he deserves respect. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He was born in 1951 in Tibet and fled that country with his family when he was eight years old. He trained in Sikkim, then founded his monastery near Kathmandu in 1976. He has focused on making authentic Tibetan Buddhist teachings available to Westerners. He has authored six books, and he regularly visits and teaches at retreat centers in many countries, including his North American retreat center in California, Rangjung Yeshe Gomde. <br> <br>David R. Shlim MD ran the world's busiest destination travel medicine clinic in Kathmandu, Nepal, for fifteen years, and was the attending physician for all the survivors of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster chronicled in Jon Krakauer's <i>Into Thin Air</i>. He currently lives in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.Especially since the 14th Dalai Lama received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, the Tibetan tradition has gained center stage in the West. This book is a simple and well-written introduction to the Tibetan variant of Buddhism, a global religion that has garnered increasing interest in the United States since Zen textbooks became available in the 1950s. In folksy English, the book explains the basics of the belief system, including the concepts of impermanence, attachment, suffering, and "emptiness suffused with compassion." Emphasizing that the Buddhist idea of "empty mind" and compassion are essentially innate and indistinguishable, the book offers simple meditation practices and visualizations (mostly having to do with concentrating on breathing) as a direct way to cultivate "nonconceptual compassion." Even though the book does not specifically target health care providers (meditation and compassion seem to be good for everyone), there are plenty of insights that will be worthwhile for caregivers. We are told that even if we are saddened because we cannot cure everyone, we can find some joy if we make our effort to help 100 percent. We are told that treatment includes gestures and nonverbal communication of reassurance, caring, calmness, and help in removing fear. We are asked to remember that we are all "waiting in line to die." Medicine and Compassion is most interesting when it touches on Tibet's unique cultural traditions. For example, it provides a dramatic glimpse into another conceptual world in its descriptions of the process of dying, during which, according to Tibetan beliefs, the spirit moves through various bardo realms, where mind-consciousness is reincarnated. Originally developed as a radical rejection of Hinduism 2500 years ago, Buddhism has always had an intense and rigorous dialogue with other religions on such issues as non-self, non-theism, and immanence. Unfortunately, this dialogue has not often taken place in the West, where Buddhism often finds itself in the environs of New Age spiritual consumerism. Although the book's introduction claims that "this is not New Age stuff," the book merges into New Age unrestrained "dispensations" as it emphasizes Buddhism as a religion of unlimited abundance that accesses the unrestricted Buddha within. This Westernized Buddhism has little to do with demand, limitation, obligation, and responsibility. Reaching enlightenment -- the arduous effort of making no effort -- is watered down to being unafraid to take a "vacation" from our hectic lives with 15 minutes of daily meditation while working toward "relaxation" (a word rarely found in any Buddhist canon). Buddhism becomes indistinguishable from what, in 1902, William James called the emerging American "Gospel of Relaxation." The weakness of this book is most evident in its discussion of Tibetan medicine itself. In fact, recognizable Tibetan medicine is not 2500 years old, as the book claims. Rather, Tibetan medicine is an amalgam of Ayurvedic, Chinese, and Hippocratic thought, synthesized with indigenous shamanism in a series of conferences inaugurated during the consolidation of the Tibetan Empire between 634 and 755 A.D. This broad-minded acceptance of diverse traditions is a rare historical example of active medical pluralism. Scholars accept that translations of some Hippocratic texts are embedded in canonical Tibetan medical books. In reading Medicine and Compassion, one easily recognizes ideas from Hippocrates's On Decorum, which states that the physician should "bear in mind his manner of sitting, [maintain] . . . decisive utterance, brevity of speech, composure, diligence, care, replies to objections, calm self-control, concentration, readiness to do what has to be done. . . . Perform all this calmly." In a curious way, the journey to the East in this book brings the reader back to Western medicine's point of departure. Medicine and Compassion is a delightful book, but for accounts that are more intellectually challenging, I would recommend Edward Conze's classic Buddhism (1951); for Tibetan Buddhism, Chogyam Trungpa's Cutting through Spiritual Materialism (1974); and for Buddhist health care perspectives, Lawrence Sullivan's Healing and Restoring (1989). <i>Ted J.

His masterpiece, <i>Flowers of Evil (Les Fleurs du Mal),</i> was dismissed as decadent and obscene and banned in France for nearly a century. Although Baudelaire died in obscurity, today he is recognized as one of the nineteenth century's greatest and most influential poets, whose works were ahead of their time. <br>This unique collection captures the fevered spirit of the transition from Romanticism to Modernism with authoritative interpretations of fifty-one poems from <i>Flowers of Evil.</i> In addition, fourteen prose poems from the posthumously published <i>Paris Spleen </i>offer poignant reflections on the city and its humbler denizens. Noted scholar Wallace Fowlie provides definitive translations of these verses.</p><p>Poet, critic, and translator Charles Baudelaire (1821-67) was deeply affected by Gothic novels and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. A leading figure of the Decadent movement, he exercised enormous influence over subsequent poets and authors, including Rimbaud, Proust, and Eliot. He published his first and most famous book of poems, <i>Flowers of Evil, </i>at the age of 36 and died less than a decade later, after a life shadowed by debt, drug abuse, and disease.<br>Translator Walter Fowlie was the James Duke Professor of French at Duke University.</p><h2>How to Write Your Best Story Ever!</h2><p>Ideal for children wanting to enter story writing competitions!

McKee explains what enables some companies to growbigger and better, while others stumble along year after year, running but never winning the race. The difference is that the biggest and best brands aren&#39;t slaves to conventional marketing wisdom. McKee shows by example how the same, sometimes counter-intuitive, strategies used by the biggest brands can also best serve small and mid-sized companies. Among the topics explored: How can a company grow big by thinking small? Why do the best companies sometimes avoid being better? Why do brands that create the most memorable advertising stay away from focus groups? What is the secret to an effective slogan? When can admitting a negative become a positive? A diverse selection of companies provides powerful lessons, ranging from traditional icons like Coca-Cola, McDonald&#39;s, and General Motors, to new media models like Google and Facebook. This book appeals not only to time- starved executives, but also to middle managers and owners of small businesses who have a wide variety of marketing problems to address and who need to change the way they think about how to generate healthy, consistent growth.</p><p>Steve McKee is the president and co-founder of McKee Wallwork &amp; Company (MWC), an integrated marketing firm that specializes in revitalizing stalled, stuck and stale brands.

She suggests that in order to work effectively in a multicultural setting, this privilege needs to be fully acknowledged and confronted. She explores whether it is possible to talk about a white identity, addresses uncomfortable feelings such as guilt or shame, and offers advice on how to implement white awareness training within an organization. </p><p>Ryde offers a model for 'white awareness' in a diverse society and provides concrete examples from her own experience. This book is essential reading for students and practitioners in the helping professions, including social workers, psychotherapists, psychologists, counsellors, healthcare workers, occupational therapists and alternative health practitioners.</p></p><p>Judy Ryde PhD is a freelance psychotherapist, supervisor and trainer of 25 years&#39; experience. She provides supervision training across the helping professions within the Centre for Supervision and Team Development. Judy also supervises the BCPC Asylum Project which provides counselling and psychotherapy for asylum seekers and refugees, and was a co-founder of Psychotherapists and Counsellors for Social Responsibility.Ryde's book, Being White in the helping professions: Developing effective intercultural awareness, attempts to address how racism impacts the effectiveness of practitioners providing mental health counselling services. Her book offers insights for practitioners who recognize the need to act as change agents towards ending racism within the policies and practices of the mental health system -- American Journal of Dance Therapy<br><br>It was with a sense of relief that I opened this book. At last someone has found the time and energy, and been supported enough, to produce a well thought-out book on this potentially sensitive topic... Ryde has fashioned a coherent approach to the topic that offers an integration of a disparate field (at least for many white people) and ways forward for white practitioners and organisations embedded in white culture. This book might be of interest to black and minority practitioners. It is essential reading for white practitioners. -- Therapy Today<br><br>It is as creative, challenging and thought provoking as it is thorough and practical. -- The Independent Practitioner Journal<br><br>As Ryde notes, the fish is unaware of the sea until taken from its environment. it is easy for white people to be blind to our assumptions and endemic racism and unconsciously to regard white ways of behaving as the norm. I highly recommend this book, and consider it required reading on counselling courses and for all white therapists who work interculturally. -- Healthcare Counselling and Psychotherapy Journal<br><br>This thought-provoking book offers an alternative view supplementing traditional equality and diversity training. It stimulates the reader to consider what 'white' culture is and how it implicitly and explicitly affects the thoughts and perceptions of not just the 'white' person but also the people around them. -- Speech &amp; Language Therapy in Practice<br><br>I found this book fascinating and thought provoking on many levels. This book will assist all those white helpers to deal with some of the more tricky racial/cultural and class issues that we all face each day. It will enable helpers and teams to question their beliefs and practice and develop concrete dialogue and stimulate change in a constructive manner. -- Avenue Consulting Wellbeing Newsletter<br><br>There is a passion in this book that is rooted in a commitment to social justice. Judy Ryde wants both practice and scholarship to be intentionally reflective about some of the problems and possibilities that surround cultural identity and its impact when working within the multi-cultural environment. The author's twenty-five years of experience in working in supervision and training is put to good use in this carefully organised and well-written book. It also a model of excellence in so far as it not only discusses the subject with intelligence and wisdom, but it also provides some solutions for good practice in developing intercultural awareness. -- Leveson Centre Newsletter<br><br>I'm impressed with the calm and scholarly practitioner approach taken in this book... a timely and useful contribution to the helping profession's challenge of creating a valued and valuable experience for all those people seeking help... An original approach to a rarely discussed challenge for all in the helping professions. -- Lord Victor Adebowale, Chief Executive of Turning Point<br><br>Engaging with Judy Ryde's passionate, scholarly, effective and original book, I feel both more and less certain about myself as a white person or white professional. This reflective state, which I expect others will share, is Ryde&#x2019;s political and psychological gift and staying in that state will be essential to my clinical work and personal life. The book will make every analyst, therapist or counsellor indeed, everyone in the helping professions - reflect on who they are as they work, far beyond what is already managed in the relational and intersubjective traditions. Ryde has managed to bring three diverse impossibilities together into one challenging whole: citizenship, professionalism and individuation. -- Andrew Samuels, Professor of Analytic Psychology, University of Essex<br><br>Judy Ryde embarks on a valiant attempt to emerge with the contentious, complex and immensely difficult issue of being white in the helping professions. Ryde provides many insights into personal growth and development in this highly charged and emotional topic. It provides individual helping practitioners wanting to act as change agents in ending racism in a profession's policies and practices with helpful tips and one woman's story of how she sought to achieve this aim. -- Professor Lena Dominelli, Head of Social, Community and Youth Work at Durham University</p><h2>Secret Lives Of Common Birds: Enjoying Bird Behavior Through the Seasons</h2><p>All around us birds are going about their lives, offering fascinating insights into how they survive and interact with one another, defending territories, courting mates, nesting, raising young, displaying, preening, feeding, and more. The difference between noticing and missing these secret lives is a little time, a relaxed mind, and some curiosity. An introduction to the world of bird behavior, <i>Secret Lives of Common Birds</i> explores many of the most important tasks in the lives of the familiar birds that enrich our lives. Wildlife photographer Marie Read has a knack for capturing the most intimate, often dramatic moments in the activities of birds. In this book, her beautiful photographs of birds in action are paired with engaging and informative descriptions of behaviors that anyone might observe in the backyard or at a local park, pond, or woodland. Her lighthearted writing style is a delight as the reader travels through the seasons of the year and discovers the secret lives of common birds.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>MARIE READ is an acclaimed wildlife photographer and nature writer whose photographs are regularly featured in magazines, books, and calendars. A birdwatcher since childhood, she has traveled throughout the world to photograph birds.Why do birds build nests? Why do they sing? Why do we sometimes see them lying in a daze on a lawn? These and other questions that an interested observer of backyard birds might ask are answered in a tidy book by a wildlife photographer. Taking a seasonal approach, the author examines what viewers can expect for each season and what the behavior they have seen means. For example, in the spring nests are built both to attract mates and to shelter young. Singing, too, attracts mates, but it also serves as the first line of territorial defense. Birds lying dazed on the grass are often sunbathing, which not only feels good but also is thought to repel parasites. Although migration is the most obvious autumn behavior, Read also explains how and why birds molt their feathers. Finding food and keeping warm are major winter activities that amateur naturalists can explore. Beautifully illustrated with the author's photos--many are exquisite close-ups--this book is an excellent start for learning why birds do what they do. <i>Nancy Bent</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This fascinating work of original scholarship makes the precise and detailed argument that painted illustrations of the Trojan War, both public and private, were a collective visual resource for selected works of Virgil, Horace, and Propertius. Carefully researched and skillfully reasoned, the author&#x2019;s claims are bold and innovative, offering a strong interpretation of the relationship between Roman visual culture and literature that will deepen modern readings of Augustan poets.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>The Museum of Augustus</i> first provides a comprehensive reconstruction of paintings from the remaining fragments of the cycle of Trojan frescoes that once decorated the Temple of Apollo in Pompeii. It then finds the echoes of these paintings in the Augustan-dated Portico of Philippus, now destroyed, which was itself a renovation of Rome&#x2019;s de facto temple of the Muses&#x2015;in other words, a museum, both in displaying art and offering a meeting place for poets. It next examines the responses of the Augustan poets to the decorative program of this monument that was intimately connected with their own literary aspirations. The book concludes by looking at the way Horace in the <i>Odes</i> and Virgil in the <i>Georgics</i> both conceptualized their poetic projects as temples to rival the museum of Augustus.</p><p>Peter Heslin is a lecturer in the Department of Classics and Ancient History at Durham University.&#x201c;Highly recommended.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Choice </i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>First Aid for the USMLE Step 2 CS</h2><p><p><b>The best-selling USMLE Step 2 CS review book--now completely updated to reflect the latest exam format!</b></p> <ul> <li>44 full-length practice cases that simulate the real exam--including pediatric and telephone interviews as well as suggested closing statements for each case </li><li>A revised and expanded set of minicases representing common complaints, designed to help you rapidly develop a set of differential diagnoses </li><li>Updated content based on feedback from recent U.S. and international test takers </li><li>Step-by-step strategies for interacting with standardized patients, including "difficult patients" </li><li>Detailed descriptions of high-yield physical exam maneuvers that will win you points without costing time </li><li>Time management advice to maximize your clinical encounters </li><li>Proven study and exam strategies from students who passed the exam</li></ul><p></p></p><p><p><b>Tao Le, MD, MHS (Louisville, KY)</b> is Assistant Clinical Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the University of Louisville.

Stephen Teiser examines one of the most important of such annual celebrations. He provides a comprehensive interpretation of the festivities of the seventh lunar month, in which laypeople presented offerings to Buddhist monks to gain salvation for their ancestors. Teiser uncovers a wide range of sources, many translated or analyzed for the first time in any language, to demonstrate how the symbolism, rituals, and mythology of the ghost festival pervaded the social landscape of medieval China.</p></p><p>Even a brief experience of the ghost festival leaves an impression of spirited diversity. My own encounter with the annual celebration began in Taiwan on September 5, 1979, when string after string of firecrackers punctuated an already fitful night of sleep. All month long hungry ghosts had been wandering the earth, released from their usual torments in the dark regions of hell to visit their families, who welcomed their own kin but warded off stranger ghosts with noisemakers and smoke.<b>Stephen F.

From this Nietzschean perspective, Francis Bacon and Ren� Descartes can be considered the founders of modernity.<br><br>Lampert argues that Bacon's positive claims for science aimed to destroy the dominance of Christianity. Descartes continued Bacon's radical program while providing it with the mathematical physics required for its success. Far from being solely an epistemological and metaphysical thinker, says Lampert, Descartes was a master writer whose comic ridicule helped bring down the Church to which he paid lip service. Both Bacon and Descartes used the Platonic art of dissimulation to achieve their ends by making their revolutionary aims appear compatible with Christianity.<br><br>Once we recognize Bacon and Descartes as legislators of modern times in a specifically Nietzschean sense, we can also see Nietzsche in a new way&#x2015;as the first thinker to have understood modern times and transcended it in a postmodern worldview. According to Lampert, Nietzsche provides a new foundation for culture, a joyous science that reveals the grandeur and purposeless play of the cosmic whole and yet avoids enervating despair or destructive, dogmatic belief.</p><p></p><h2>Shifting Gears: Technology, Literature, Culture in Modernist America</h2><p><i>Shifting Gears</i> is a richly illustrated exploration of the American era of gear-and-girder technology. From the 1890s to the 1920s machines and structures shaped by this technology emerged in many forms, from automobiles and harvesting machines to bridges and skyscrapers. The most casual onlooker to American life saw examples of the new technology on Main Street, on the local railway platform, and in the pages of popular magazines. <br><br>A major consequence of this technology was its effect on the arts, in particular the literary arts. Three prominent American writers of the time -- Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, and William Carlos Williams -- became designer-engineers of the word. Tichi reveals their use of prefabricated, manufactured components in poems and prose. As designers, they enacted in style and structure the new technological values. The writers, according to Tichi, thought of words themselves as objects for assembly into a design.<br><br>Using materials from magazines, popular novels , movie reviews, the toy industry, and advertising, as well as the texts of the nation's major enduring writers, Tichi shows how turn-of-the-century technology pervaded every aspect of American culture and how this culture could be defined as a collaborative effort of the engineer, the architect, the fiction writer, and the poet. She demonstrates that a technological revolution is not a revolution only of science but of language as well.<br><br>Originally published in 1987.<br><br>A UNC Press Enduring Edition -- UNC Press Enduring Editions use the latest in digital technology to make available again books from our distinguished backlist that were previously out of print.

This full-view understanding enables students to think sensibly about terrorism and better understand effective, and equally important, ineffective measures within counterterrorism. Appropriate for undergraduate and graduate-level courses in criminal justice and homeland security, as well as political science and sociology departments, Counterterrorism focuses on domestic terrorist groups from Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America, and North America. It offers critical evaluation of the counterterrorism measures implemented in response to these terrorist groups. Using a multidisciplinary approach, this comprehensive resource compares terrorist groups, assesses the factors that are conducive to certain groups&#x2019; sustainability and those that led to other groups&#x2019; demise, and notes measures that were successfully used in the past to combat terrorists and terrorist groups worldwide. This text also incorporates efficient policies into a strategy that can be used to effectively contend with the current threat of terrorism by al-Qaeda operatives, affiliates, and homegrown terrorists inspired by al-Qaeda&#x2019;s cause.<br><br>Key Features:<br>-Employs an international scope and multi-group approach to provide students with a full understanding of terrorism and terrorist groups, not simply al-Qaeda.<br>-Provides comprehensive coverage of the theory behind terrorists' motivations and actions for students to grasp how and why terrorist groups act as they do.<br>-Contains boxes with case studies corresponding to the material as well as "Food for Thought" sections throughout, offering interesting research topics and questions on counterterrorism practices.<br>-Includes end-of-chapter review questions and hypothetical terrorist scenarios which test students on their comprehension of the section material and confirm that they understand terrorist groups' goals, capabilities, tactical profile, targeting pattern, and operational area, and the appropriateness of selected measures to counter these threats.</p><p>Associate Professor, John Jay College of Criminal Justice</p><h2>Mystic Quest: An Introduction to Jewish Mysticism</h2><p>The Mystic Quest is a lucid, accessible introduction to the esoteric mystical tradition in Judaism known as Kabbalah.<br><br>Jewish mysticism is a rich and varied tradition of secret teachings and practices that has been a part of Judaism since antiquity. Ariel locates the Jewish mystical tradition within the context of Jewish history and traces its evolution throughout the ages, concluding with the role of mysticism in contemporary Judaism.<br><br>David S. Ariel is president of the Cleveland College of Jewish Studies.</p><p><i>The Mystic Quest</i> by David S. Ariel may be the most accessible and sophisticated introduction to Jewish mysticism available. Ariel starts by comparing Jewish mysticism to Christian mystical traditions, drawing on writers such as William James and Sigmund Freud to define his terms. He then provides a history of Jewish mysticism, starting with Ezekiel's vision of the chariot and working up to the present day, with special attention to the ways that kabbalah has influenced mainstream Judaism. (One notable detail is that Lekha Dodi, or "Come, My Beloved," the Friday-evening prayer, is a hymn to the kabbalist-derived feminine dimension of God.) In the book's concluding chapters, Ariel gives practical advice about how contemporary Jews can cultivate mystical spirituality. By demonstrating the pervasive mystical dimension of Jewish culture, Ariel gives his Jewish readers the great gift of enlarging their understanding of what they already know, enabling them to find new revelation in the religion that has always guided them. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>"David Ariel reveals the secrets of the Kabbalah with masterful clarity. . . .

With the unwitting help of its users, the generative Internet is on a path to a lockdown, ending its cycle of innovation&#x2014;and facilitating unsettling new kinds of control.</p><p>IPods, iPhones, Xboxes, and TiVos represent the first wave of Internet-centered products that can&#x2019;t be easily modified by anyone except their vendors or selected partners. These &#x201c;tethered appliances&#x201d; have already been used in remarkable but little-known ways: car GPS systems have been reconfigured at the demand of law enforcement to eavesdrop on the occupants at all times, and digital video recorders have been ordered to self-destruct thanks to a lawsuit against the manufacturer thousands of miles away. New Web 2.0 platforms like Google mash-ups and Facebook are rightly touted&#x2014;but their applications can be similarly monitored and eliminated from a central source.

Most people think the Internet is a good thing, so why try to stop it?</p><p><b>A:</b> The Internet is a great thing and it's largely a historical accident that we have it at all. As late as the early 1990s, people in the know assumed that one of a handful of proprietary networks would be the network of the future.&nbsp;Those networks carefully groomed the content to be presented to people.&nbsp;The Internet came out of left field as an entity with no plan for content, no CEO not even a main menu.&nbsp;PCs are similarly surprisingly successful.&nbsp;Unlike "information appliances" such as smart typewriters and word processors, the programs on a PC can come from anywhere.&nbsp;This has vaulted the PC into the front lines of business environments, not just homes. Unfortunately that's not how the future is shaping up. Our own choices, made in fear, are causing the most valuable features of our modern technology to slip away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Q:</b> You warn that the Internet, and the computers that sit on the ends of it, will become more like appliances if we aren&#x2019;t careful. What do you mean by that?</p><p><b>A:</b> Devices like Apple's iPhone are incredibly sophisticated and flexible.&nbsp; But they can be programmed only by their vendors. That's very, very limiting and yet consumers will ask for that because it makes for a more consistent experience, and because our generative PC and Internet technologies are less and less useful due to spam, spyware, viruses, and other exploitations of their openness.&nbsp;We need to combat these exploitations in ways that don't sacrifice fundamental openness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Q:</b> Is it possible to have it both ways: to have a secure Internet that remains open to the possibilities you describe in your book?</p><p><b>A:</b> Yes, and the book goes into detail about how we might thread this needle.&nbsp;If we fail, we return to the old models of consumer technology that we had already (and rightly) forgotten thanks to the Internet's success.</p>Jonathan Zittrain is the George Bemis Professor of International Law at Harvard Law School and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Professor of Computer Science at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Director of the Harvard Law School Library, and Co-Founder of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society. &nbsp;His research interests include battles for control of digital property and content, cryptography, electronic privacy, the roles of intermediaries within Internet architecture, human computing, and the useful and unobtrusive deployment of technology in education.<br> &nbsp;<br> He performed the first large-scale tests of Internet filtering in China and Saudi Arabia, and as part of the OpenNet Initiative co-edited a series of studies of Internet filtering by national governments: <i>Access Denied: The Practice and Policy of Global Internet Filtering</i>; <i>Access Controlled: The Shaping of Power, Rights, and Rule in Cyberspace</i>; and <i>Access Contested: Security, Identity, and Resistance in Asian Cyberspace</i>. &nbsp;<br><br> He is a member of the Board of Directors of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Board of Advisors for <i>Scientific American</i>. &nbsp;He has served as a Trustee of the Internet Society, and as a Forum Fellow of the World Economic Forum, which named him a Young Global Leader, and as Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence at the Federal Communications Commission, where he previously chaired the Open Internet Advisory Committee.</p><h2>Star Trek: The Next Generation - Triangle: Imzadi II</h2><p>A sequel to the best-selling Star Trek love story follows Troi&#39;s troubled romance with Lieutenant Commander Worf and the personal issues she faced in coming to terms with her lingering feelings for Riker.</p><p>Peter David is the bestselling author of several previous <i>Star Trek</i>� novels, including <i>Star Trek: New Frontier, Q-Squared, Q-In-Law, Vendetta,</i> and, of course, <i>Imzadi.</i> He lives on Long Island.<p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> Riker had no warning before the shock prod tapped him in the small of the back. Immediately he died, temporarily, from the waist down. He hated the occasions when it happened, the feeling of total helplessness. The knowledge that the fall was inevitable was more grueling and hurtful to him than the fall itself. </p><p> He hit the ground hard, as he always did on such occasions. He dropped his ore breaker in the hopes of cushioning some of the fall with his hands, and he was partly successful -- but only partly, as the base of his hands crunched into the hard ground. He felt the jolt all the way up his elbows, and he gasped low in his throat. Then he braced himself for the inevitable kick. It came just as he had expected, a sharp blow to the stomach. In his first days in captivity, that had always been the worst, those stomach blows. Over time, however, he had learned to anticipate them, and he was able to condition himself against them. Just before the impact, he consciously tightened the muscles of his stomach so that a good deal of the impact was blunted. In his fantasies, his gut became so unassailable that his tormentor wound up breaking his ankle. </p><p> It was a very nice fantasy. </p><p> "Get up, Riker," said his captor, and he was kicked again. This time he didn't let out so much as a grunt, and the lack of response on his part seemed to incite his tormentor all the more. "Well?" </p><p> And Riker managed to get out, "Please, sir...I want...some more... </p><p> The guard stared down at him in utter confusion. "All right...if that's your true desire..." He was about to kick Riker a third time, and then a sharp voice stayed the blow. </p><p> "That's enough," it said. </p><p> The Cardassian jailer lowered his foot and turned his attention to the individual who had spoken. The Jailer, whose name was Mudak, was a beefy fellow, but anyone thinking him fat would have been in for a rude shock. Any excess on his frame was pure muscle, and when he moved it was with speed that was blinding. Mudak could be standing two feet away, his hands at his side, and you could suddenly be knocked on your back before you had the slightest awareness that a punch was coming. </p><p> He was also tall, and his eyes were the most striking thing about him. They were dark and pitiless; one would get more sympathy from a black hole than from those eyes. When Riker looked into those eyes, they reminded him of a shark's. They regarded him, and the other prisoners, with an air that clearly indicated that he didn't care whether they lived or died. </p><p> Mudak looked at the individual who had interrupted his sport. It was a Romulan, a head taller than Mudak, with graying hair and a darkly imperious look. In truth, the Romulan had no more status in this place of torment than did Riker. It was as if, in his manner and deportment, he was not interested in acknowledging his relatively low status in the grand scheme of things. From his attitude, it would have been unlikely that any bystander would have realized that Mudak was the jailer and the Romulan the prisoner. </p><p> Yet despite the Cardassian's ostensible authority over the Romulan, Mudak did not seem inclined to press the point. Instead he said, with a level voice that bordered on malevolence, "This is none of your affair, Saket." </p><p> Saket looked from the fallen Riker to Mudak. "It is now, Mudak. And you will leave this human alone." </p><p> "He was moving too slowly," Mudak retorted. "He was daydreaming." </p><p> Saket took a step closer so that he was almost in Mudak's face. "Leave him his dreams, Mudak. In the final analysis, what else have we in this place?" </p><p> Mudak considered this for a moment, and then he laughed low in his throat. It was an eerie noise, as if he were exercising muscles that were nearly atrophied from disuse. In a low voice he rumbled, "Someday, Saket, you will lose your usefulness to my superiors. And on that final day, you will pay for your arrogance." </p><p> "We all pay on the final day, Mudak," Saket said imperturbably. "Jailors and jailed alike; we all pay then." </p><p> Mudak's hands idly twisted on the shaft of the shock prod, as if contemplating shoving it down Saket's throat or into an even more inconvenient bodily orifice. But apparently he thought better of it. Instead he lightly tapped the now-deactivated end of the prod against his forehead in a sardonic salute and moved off. Saket then crouched next to the fallen Riker. "You should be able to feel something in your legs by now. He had the prod on one of the lower settings." </p><p> "I thought as much," grunted Riker. "This time around it was just agonizing instead of incredibly agonizing." </p><p> "You see? Your sense of humor returns already." </p><p> Saket stood, got a firm grip under Riker's arms, and hauled him to his feet. For a moment, Riker felt practically nothing beneath him, and Saket had to move him around bodily to try and get some sense of motion going. "One leg after the other," intoned Saket, "that's it, lad." </p><p> Under Saket's urging, Riker forced himself to move his legs and started to feel growing strength with every step. "Keep going," urged Saket, helping Riker move in a small circle. Within minutes, Riker was walking about in a manner fairly close to his normal strength and stride. "Come, Riker...let us go for a walk. you and I." And with that, the two of them made their slow way across the compound. "Were you out of your mind just before? Saying you wanted more?" </p><p> "It was...it was a quote...from a book, actually...about orphans, <i>Oliver Twist.</i> Author's name was Dickens...I felt it appropriate...since in a way I don't have a mother or father...I'm just sort of...of here..." </p><p> "You're babbling, Riker." </p><p> "No, I'm fine...truly. Dickens...great author...you should read him...<i>Bleak House</i>...story of my life...<i>Tale of Two Cities</i>...about two men who look alike, and one sacrifices himself for the other...never realized when I was reading him as a boy...how much resonance...he'd have for me..." </p><p> "Whatever you say, Riker," Saket said, shaking his head. </p><p> "Saket," Riker said, "we haven't known each other long.

Rowland</b>, editors of <i>Free at Last</i> (The New Press), teach history at the University of Maryland. They are former and present directors, respectively, of the Freedmen and Southern Society Project, which is compiling a multivolume documentary history of the transition from slavery to freedom.<br>Berlin and Rowland, editors of the prize-winning collection Free at Last, have come up with another moving documentary history, this one focusing on black family life in the Civil War era. Told mostly from the perspectives of black soldiers and their families, these poignant letters show the devotion and love that existed among African-American relatives despite all efforts to destroy slave families. Slaves were usually discouraged by their masters from forming familial relationships--they were split up regularly when relatives were sold; there was no official recognition of slave marriages--yet many slaves managed to nurture close families. During the Civil War, these relationships were sorely tested, as families were again separated, women and children left, even after liberation, among their embittered former owners. Yet it is hard to say who was more destructive of the black family during the war--the North or the South. The federal government was shameful in its treatment of black soldiers fighting for the Union: Letters here attest to the fact that they were often forcefully conscripted and received less than half the pay of their white counterparts. Their families receieved little or none of the promised assistance, and the soldiers were denied furlough or required to pay dearly for it, even when the war was over. As one ``umble soldier'' who could not get leave wrote to the secretary of war to beg permission to visit his family: ``In August I lost two of my children. I asked for a leaf [sic] of absence and was refused. . . . Now the war is over and I now want to see those who are dearer to me than my life.''

Clever scholars skeptical of our earliest surviving source, Herodotus, have produced one ingenious theory after another. In this stimulating new book, bound to provoke controversy, Peter Krentz argues that Herodotus was right after all.</p><p>Beginning his analysis with the Athenians&#x2019; first formal&nbsp;contact with the Persians in 507 BCE, Krentz weaves together ancient evidence with travelers&#x2019; descriptions, archaeological discoveries, geological surveys, and the experiences of modern reenactors and soldiers to tell his story.</p><p>Krentz argues that before Marathon the Athenian army fought in a much less organized way than the standard view of the hoplite phalanx suggests: as an irregularly armed mob rather than a disciplined formation of identically equipped infantry. At Marathon the Athenians equipped all their fighters, including archers and horsemen, as hoplites for the first time. Because their equipment weighed only half as much as is usually thought, the Athenians and their Plataean allies could charge almost a mile at a run, as Herodotus says they did. Krentz improves on this account in Herodotus by showing <i>why </i>the Athenians wanted to do such a risky thing.</p></p><p><b>Peter Krentz</b> is W. R. Grey Professor of Classics and History, Davidson College, where he has taught Greek and Roman history since 1979."I love this book! It accomplishes so much at such short length.

Rather, Krasner was mainly known as the wife of Jackson Pollock and Lewis, as an African American artist, struggled for recognition.<br> &nbsp;<br> Krasner&#x2019;s and Lewis&#x2019;s works from the height of the Abstract Expressionist movement share many qualities, including pictographic iconographies, allusions to writing, relatively small scales, and allover patterning.&nbsp;<i>From the Margins</i>&nbsp;therefore imagines a kind of conversation between these two artists, juxtaposing works from each to encourage visual and conceptual dialogues. An introductory essay delves into the challenges Krasner and Lewis faced in an artistic community dominated by white men, mainly concerning issues of identity, otherness, and marginalization in postwar American abstraction.&nbsp;Reasserting the influence and talent of these two significant artists, this book offers a vital and much-needed addition to the existing scholarship on modern art.&nbsp;</p><p>This publication gives long overdue credit to two artists whose breakthrough contributions to Abstract Expressionism have largely gone unrecognized.<br><b>Norman L.

Author Anne Morgan Spalter interviews contemporary artists for insights into their favorite techniques and approaches to planning, developing, and outputting their artwork. Anyone who uses a PC for creating digital art should look to this book for guidance on the technical, practical, and theoretical aspects of design and production.<p> Although the author uses plenty of technical detail, historical facts, and art theory, the book also includes a good deal of practical information. For example, <i>The Computer in the Visual Arts</i> covers popular software programs; explains different types of printers, including their benefits and drawbacks; and defines terms (helpfully, in boldface) succinctly, so you can learn the basics. The chapters on 3D graphics are a perfect example, explaining simple terms such as primitives and lofting; defining more technical terms such as fractals and other algorithmic processes; and offering hands-on insight into how artists use 3D software, special effects, and rendering processes creatively.</p><p> Chapters end with suggestions for further reading and exercises you can work through on your own. The book provides loads of information on composition--that is, arranging the form and color of artwork and deciding on the use of space and scale. There are many images from contributing artists with explanations of their approach to digital art, and more of these images are included in a four-color section. The appendices to the book discuss contemporary art periods such as modernism and postmodernism, elements of computer theory such as symbolic logic, and lists of URLs and books you can turn to for more information. <i>--Kathleen Caster</i></p><p> Introducing a dynamic medium for artistic expression and graphic communication </p><p>"This is a seminal contributionoa must-read for anyone interested in how computers are used in art and design.

Crafted specifically for undergraduates who are studying the subject for the first time, and requiring minimal prerequisites, the book focuses on the essential fundamentals of computer science theory and features a practical approach that uses real computer programs (Python and Java) and encourages active experimentation. It is also ideal for self-study and reference.</p><p>The book covers the standard topics in the theory of computation, including Turing machines and finite automata, universal computation, nondeterminism, Turing and Karp reductions, undecidability, time-complexity classes such as P and NP, and NP-completeness, including the Cook-Levin Theorem. But the book also provides a broader view of computer science and its historical development, with discussions of Turing's original 1936 computing machines, the connections between undecidability and G�del's incompleteness theorem, and Karp's famous set of twenty-one NP-complete problems.</p><p>Throughout, the book recasts traditional computer science concepts by considering how computer programs are used to solve real problems. Standard theorems are stated and proven with full mathematical rigor, but motivation and understanding are enhanced by considering concrete implementations.

(Cassell Military Paperbacks)</h2><p>The doctors and nurses who worked in the Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals (MASH) during the Korean War were well trained, dedicated, and pushed to the brink. And they were young - too young to be doing what they had to do. As Richard Hooker writes in the Foreword, &#39;A few flipped their lids, but most of them just raised hell, in a variety of ways and degrees.&#39; Meet the true-life heroes and lunatics who fought in the Korean War, and experience the martini-laced mornings, marathon high jinks, sexual escapades, and that perfectly corrupt football game that every fan of the movie will remember. It&#39;s also a story of hard work and skill in the face of enormous pressure and odds. Here is where it all began - the novel that made M*A*S*H a legend.</p><p>Before there were the movie and the television series, there was the novel that gave birth to such American immortals as Hawkeye and Trapper John, Hot Lips Houlihan, Frank Burns, Radar O&#39;Reilly, and the rest of the 4077th MASH--a place like no place else in Korea or on earth.Born in New Jersey in 1924, H. Richard Hornberger attended Cornell Medical School and became a physician for the US Army during the Korean War. After the war, he worked for the Veterans Administration and went into private practice. Writing under the name Richard Hooker, Hornberger used his experiences at the 8055th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital as the basis for MASH. The novel was an international success and was later adapted into the film and TV series of the same name.

Raised in Hamburg and educated at the University of Bonn and later at the University of Munich, he began his career as a poet and translator into German of many English and French writers, including Balzac, Flaubert, Gide, Swift, and Wilde. His first novel, <i>Fanny Essler</i>, appeared in 1905; his second, <i>Maurermeister Ihle&#x2019;s Haus</i> (Mastermason Ihle&#x2019;s House), in the following year. He left Germany in 1909 for the United States. <br><br>In 1912, under the new name of Frederick Philip Grove, he began teaching school in Manitoba, and continued in that profession until 1924. <br><br>Grove&#x2019;s first book in English, <i>Over Prairie Trails</i>, is a sequence of seven sketches of his weekly trips through the Manitoba countryside.

In 1931 he settled on a farm near Simcoe, Ontario, where he spent the final years of his life.<br><br>Frederick Philip Grove died in Simcoe, Ontario, in 1948.On the road leading north from the little prairie town Minor two men were fighting their way through the gathering dusk.<br><br>Both were recent immigrants; one, Lars Nelson, a giant, of three years&#x2019; standing in the country; the other, Niels Lindstedt, slightly above medium size, but compactly built, of only three months&#x2019;. Both were Swedes; and they had struck up a friendship which had led to a partnership for the winter that was coming. They had been working on a threshing gang between Minor and Balfour and were now on their way into the bush settlement to the north-east where scattered homesteads reached out into the wilderness.<br><br>It was the beginning of the month of November.<br><br>Niels carried his suitcase on his back; Nelson, his new friend&#x2019;s bundle, which also held the few belongings of his own which he had along. He wore practically the same clothes winter and summer.<br>Above five miles from town they reached, on the north road, the point where the continuous settlement ran out into the wild, sandy land which, forming the margin of the Big Marsh, intervened between the territory of the towns and the next Russo-German settlement to the north, some twenty miles or so straight ahead.<br><br>At this point the road leapt the Muddy River and passed through its sheltering fringe of bush to strike out over a sheer waste of heath-like country covered with low, creeping brush. The wind which had been soughing through the tree tops had free sweep here; and an exceedingly fine dust of dry, powdery ice-crystals began to fly &#x2014; you could hardly call it snow so far.<br><br>It did not occur to Niels to utter or even harbour apprehensions. His powerful companion knew the road; where he went, Niels could go.<br><br>They swung on, for the most part in silence.<br><br>The road became a mere trail; but for a while longer it was plainly visible in the waning light of the west; in the smooth ruts a film of white was beginning to gather.<br><br>The wind came in fits and starts, out of the hollow north-west; and with the engulfing dark an ever thickening granular shower of snow blew from the low-hanging clouds. As the trail became less and less visible, the very ground underfoot seemed to slide to the south-east.<br><br>By that time they had made about half the distance they intended to make. To turn back would have given them only the advantage of going with, instead of against, the gathering gale. Both were eager to get to work again: Nelson had undertaken to dig wells for two of the older settlers in the bush country; and he intended to clear a piece of his own land during the winter and to sell the wood which he had accumulated the year before.<br><br>They came to a fork in the trail and struck north-east. Soon after the turn Nelson stopped.<br><br>&#x201c;Remember the last house?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Niels, speaking Swedish.<br><br>&#x201c;From there on, for twenty miles north and for ten miles east the land is open for homestead entry. But it is no good. Mere sand that blows with the wind as soon as the brush is taken off.&#x201d;<br><br>They plodded on for another hour. The trail was crossed and criss-crossed by cattle paths.

Tomory argues that gas was the first integrated large-scale technological network, a designation usually given to the railways. He shows how the first gas network was constructed and stabilized through the introduction of new management structures, the use of technical controls, and the application of means to constrain the behavior of the users of gas lighting.</p><p>Tomory begins by describing the contributions of pneumatic chemistry and industrial distillation to the development of gas lighting, then explores the bifurcation between the Continental and British traditions in distillation technology. He examines the establishment and consolidation of the new industry by the Birmingham firm Boulton &amp; Watt, and describes the deployment of the network strategy by the entrepreneur Frederick Winsor. Tomory argues that the gas industry represented a new wave of technological innovation in industry because of its dependence on formal scientific research, its need for large amounts of capital, and its reliance on business organization beyond small firms and partnerships&#x2015;all of which signaled a departure from the artisanal nature and limited deployment of inventions earlier in the Industrial Revolution. Gas lighting was the first important realization of the Enlightenment dream of science in the service of industry.</p></p><p>Leslie Tomory, an aerospace engineer, a historian, and a consultant in the nonprofit sector, is currently a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at McGill University.<p>Leslie Tomory has written one of the finest industry studies of the Industrial Revolution to appear in many decades. The gas light industry is conceptually as important to the understanding of economic growth in early-nineteenth-century Europe as cotton and steam, and his book is the definitive study of it. This intelligent and meticulously-researched work should be required reading for students of the Industrial Revolution and anyone interested in innovation in an earlier age.</p>&#x2015;<b>Joel Mokyr</b>, Professor of Economics, Northwestern University<br><br><p>In this fascinating history of the origins of the coal gas industry, Leslie Tomory offers important insights into the connections between science and technology in the Industrial Revolution and the role played by entrepreneurs in early industrialization. In the process he also adds greatly to our understanding of the emergence of large-scale technological systems in the nineteenth century.</p>&#x2015;<b>Paul Israel</b>, Director and General Editor, Thomas A. Edison Papers Project, Rutgers University<br><br><p>Leslie Tomory has produced a comprehensive history of the origins and early development of gas lighting that will appeal especially to historians of chemistry and chemical technology, as well as social and economic historians. In a splendidly rich narrative that links chemistry with technology and urban history, Tomory argues convincingly that gas lighting was part of the first wave of science-based technologies to be exploited in the service and improvement of mankind.</p>&#x2015;<b>William H. Brock</b>, Emeritus Professor of History of Science, University of Leicester, UK<br><br><p>Leslie Tomory's account is original, insightful, and admirably researched, the first to show convincingly and in detail how the technology of a major industry had its beginnings in an instrument invented in the chemistry laboratory. He makes a compelling argument for considering gaslight as the first major science-based network technology of the industrial era. This is an important book.</p>&#x2015;<b>Trevor Levere</b>, University of Toronto</p><h2>Real-Life BPMN: With introductions to CMMN and DMN</h2><p>This is the improved 3rd edition of the very successful book "Real-Life BPMN" with excellent reviews on Amazon.com (don't forget to check reviews of the 1st and 2nd edition). It is about business process management (BPM) and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0). Truth be told, there are several BPMN books on the market. Some of them are quite good, so why should you care about this one? This book distills the experience the authors accumulated while running Camunda, a consulting company that specializes in BPM. Camunda helped to define the BPMN specification, and during the past ten years, they have applied BPMN in over 1000 customer engagements. These were big businesses, small companies, and public institutions. Now you can benefit from this practical experience. Topics covered: <ul> <li>The basics of modeling processes with Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0)</li> <li>Methods to apply BPMN successfully to real-world problems</li> <li>A practical approach for automating processes with BPMN 2.0</li> <li>The alignment of business and IT as an attainable goal</li> <li>Advice on introducing BPMN across your company</li> </ul> This book explains the notation, of course, but it also delves into the kinds of challenges that process designers face every day. It talks about pitfalls to avoid. It gives dos and don'ts. There are guidelines and best practices. In the 3rd edition we added introductions to the related BPM standards <ul> <li>CMMN 1.1 for case management, handling unstructured processes</li> <li>DMN 1.1 for decision management, you might know as business rules management (BRM)</li> </ul> This third edition in English is based on the successful fith German edition, which, according to amazon.de, it is the highest-ranked book on BPMN in German. The number of five-star ratings awarded by readers speaks volumes. Also available in Spanish.</p><p>Bernd R�cker and Jakob Freund have more than 10 years of experience working in the fi eld of BPM as consultants and trainers. They founded Camunda, a company that focuses on BPM from both business and IT perspectives.

Art historians, artists, and anyone who wants to use the images of others will find themselves awash in byzantine legal terms, constantly evolving copyright law, varying interpretations by museums and estates, and despair over the complexity of the whole situation. Here, on a white&#x2014;not a high&#x2014;horse, Susan Bielstein offers her decades of experience as an editor working with illustrated books. In doing so, she unsnarls the threads of permissions that have ensnared scholars, critics, and artists for years.<br> <br> Organized as a series of &#x201c;takes&#x201d; that range from short sidebars to extended discussions, <i>Permissions, A Survival Guide</i> explores intellectual property law as it pertains to visual imagery. How can you determine whether an artwork is copyrighted? How do you procure a high-quality reproduction of an image? What does &#x201c;fair use&#x201d; really mean? Is it ever legitimate to use the work of an artist without permission? Bielstein discusses the many uncertainties that plague writers who work with images in this highly visual age, and she does so based on her years navigating precisely these issues. As an editor who has hired a photographer to shoot an incredibly obscure work in the Italian mountains (a plan that backfired hilariously), who has tried to reason with artists' estates in languages she doesn't speak, and who has spent her time in the archival trenches, she offers a snappy and humane guide to this difficult terrain.<br> <br> Filled with anecdotes, asides, and real courage, <i>Permissions, A Survival Guide</i> is a unique handbook that anyone working in the visual arts will find invaluable, if not indispensable.</p></p><p><b>Susan M. Bielstein</b> is executive editor for art, architecture, classical studies, and film at the University of Chicago Press and a trustee of the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts. She has lectured widely on publishing issues and has taught graduate and postdoctoral writing workshops at numerous universities.&#34;Approachable, engaging, and authoritative, Permissions, A Survival Guide is a clear and convincing guide to the world of picture reproduction and permissions.&#34; - Adrian Johns, author of The Nature of the Book&#34;</p><h2>The Modern Firm: Organizational Design for Performance and Growth (Clarendon Lectures in Management Studies)</h2><p>Business firms around the world are experimenting with new organizational designs, changing their formal architectures, their routines and processes, and their corporate cultures as they seek to improve their current performance and their growth prospects. In the process they are changing the scope of their business operations, redrawing their organization charts, redefining the allocation of decision-making authority and responsibility, revamping the mechanisms for motivating and rewarding people, reconsidering which activities to conduct in-house and which to out-source, redesigning their information systems, and seeking to alter the shared beliefs, values and norms that their people hold. <br>In this book, John Roberts argues that there are predictable, necessary relationships among these changes that will improve performance and growth. The organizations that are successful will establish patterns of fit among the elements of their organizational designs, their competitive strategies and the external environment in which they operate and will go about this in a holistic manner. <br><br><em>The Modern Firm</em> develops powerful conceptual frameworks for analyzing the interrelations between organizational design features, competitive strategy and the business environment. Written in a non-technical language, the book is nevertheless based on rigorous modeling and draws on numerous examples from eighteenth century fur trading companies to such modern firms such as BP and Nokia. Finally the book explores why these developments are happening now, pointing to the increase in global competition and changes in technology. <br><br>Written by one of the world's leading economists and experts that will improve performance and growth.

Samuelson Professor of Economics, MIT<p></p><br>"At BP we have found John Roberts' ideas and concepts to be powerful, and we have used them in addressing the issues we face. The holistic approach he advocates to organizational design is very much in line with my own thinking. I am pleased that these ideas have been made available in a systematic fashion in this timely book."--Sir John Browne, Group Chief Executive, BP plc<p></p><br>"There are plenty of books on management and leadership that explain what leading firms do. This one explains why. The penetrating insights in <em>The Modern Firm</em> can profitably be applied to a wide variety of strategy and organization problems. Roberts, an economist of the first rank, offers us a practical, readable discussion, without mathematical notation. <em>The Modern Firm</em> should be required reading for corporate leaders and their advisers."--<em>Jonathan Day, Partner, McKinsey &amp; Company</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Just So Stories Set : For Little Children</h2><p>Just So Stories Set : For Little Children [paperback] Kipling, Rudyard [Jan 01, 1991]</p><p></p><h2>Caligula: The Corruption of Power</h2><p>Of all Roman emperors none, with the possible exception of Nero, surpasses Caligula's reputation for infamy. But was Caligula really the mad despot and depraved monster of popular legend or the victim of hostile ancient historians?<br>In this study of Caligula's life, reign and violent death, Anthony A. Barrett draws on the archaeological and numismatic evidence to supplement the later written record. In Professor Barrett's view, the mystery of Caligula's reign is not why he descended into autocracy, but how any intelligent Roman could have expected a different outcome - to grant total power to an inexperienced and arrogant young man was a recipe for disaster. This book, scholarly and accessible, offers a careful reconstruction of Caligula's life and times, and a shrewd assessment of his historical importance.</p><p>Making judicious use of the often incomplete and inconsistent sources from the life and rule of Caligula, Roman emperor A.D. 37-41, Barrett has succeeded in writing a detailed and full study intended to appeal to informed readers and students of Roman history. The historical significance of Caligula's reign is also examined, e.g., his treatment of Jews and plans to conquer Britain. In sum, Barrett's book offers new insights into a figure often avoided by academic biographers.<br><i>- Jackson P.

Islam is not only a focal point in relations between Malays and non-Malays, but also in the Malay ethnic community since Islam is integral to its culture and identity and is involved in a tense, dialectical relationship with Malay ethnicity. The Malay tendency to opt for ethnic Malay-based solutions instead of an Islamic alternative results in an upsurge of Malay ethnic nationalism, and is here explored against the backdrop of the current Islamic resurgence in Malaysia.</p><p></p><h2>The View from Mount Calvary: 24 Portraits of the Cross Throughout Scripture</h2><p><p>Without Jesus, the Bible makes no sense.

Exploring the economic, cultural, and political role of slavery, the volume shows the similarities as well as the differences in different times and places. While focusing primarily on the Americas, the volume extends to a consideration of slavery in other societies in the classical world, Africa, Asia, and the contemporary world. With over 150 selections, varying from one paragraph to several pages in length, the volume ranges widely, from international slave trade regulations and the individual records of slaveowners, to legislative debate concerning the emancipation of slaves. The volume aims to show the diversity of human experiences of slavery, and explains the causes of both the ending as well as the origins of slavery. Covering many aspects of slavery, the volume considers the ways in which slavery has been justified and attacked, the operations of slave societies, and the experiences of those living in them. Selections are drawn from a wide variety of sources, such as biblical and philosophical discussions, the writings of slaves, slaveowners, abolitionists, economists, lawyers, and historians. In addition, the volume includes selections from many leading historians and economists studying slavery and emancipation.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stanley L.

Sigmund Freud's library&#x2015;no exception to this trend&#x2015;was filled with individual photographs and images in books. According to Mary Bergstein, these photographs also profoundly shaped Freud's thinking in ways that were no less important because they may have been involuntary and unconscious. In Mirrors of Memory, lavishly illustrated with reproductions of the photos from Freud's voluminous collection, she argues that studying the man and his photographs uncovers a key to the origins of psychoanalysis. </p><p>In Freud's era, photographs were viewed as transparent windows revealing objective truth but at the same time were highly subjective, resembling a kind of dream-memory. Thus, a photo of a ruined temple both depicted the particular place and conveyed a sense of loss, oblivion, of time passing and past, and provided entry into the language of the psychoanalytic project. Bergstein seeks to understand how various kinds of photographs&#x2015;of sculptures; archaeological sites in Greece, Rome, and Egypt; medical conditions; ethnographic scenes&#x2015;fed into Freud's thinking as he elaborated the concepts of psychoanalysis. The result is a book that makes a significant contribution to our understanding of early twentieth century visual culture even as it shows that photography shaped the ways in which the great archaeologist of the human mind saw and thought about the world.</p></p><p><p>Mary Bergstein is Professor in the History of Art and Visual Culture at the Rhode Island School of Design. She is author of <i>The Sculpture of Nanni di Banco</i> and has written extensively on art, photography, and culture.</p><p>"This is an excellent book: not just an itinerary of Freud's visual world, but an exploration of the ways his visual choices influenced his 'cognitive style.' In a series of careful and detailed case studies, Bergstein shows how photographic practices altered and directed Freud&#x2019;s thinking about subjects as diverse as the appearance of Rome, Egypt, and Athens, Michelangelo&#x2019;s Moses, the Gradiva relief, and the Laoco�n. <i>Mirrors of Memory</i> argues that for Freud, photography&#x2019;s influence was 'involuntary, even unconscious': it supported and guided discrete research projects, but it also 'analogized' modes of seeing. There is a wonderful diversity of themes in the book: photography as material and model of dreams, as a prompt for 'involuntary memory,' as the seed of art historical fantasies and structures of knowledge, as talisman for analytic work, as metaphor for the working of the psyche, as a 'ghostly surrogate,' even as the emblem of 'modernist superstition.' This is an exemplary study: it is philosophically engaged historiography, impeccable archival research, and rigorously interdisciplinary visual studies."</p> (James Elkins, author of <i>The Domain of Images</i>)<br><br><p>"Mary Bergstein combines her talents as an art historian with a sophisticated approach to Freud and psychoanalytic theory. <i>Mirrors of Memory</i> tells us much about the mentality of turn-of-the-century visual culture in central Europe and the impact of that mentality on the development of Freud's thought. Photography as a medium in general&#x2015;and the roles of art and archaeology photography in particular&#x2015;played a crucial mediating role in the emergence of Freud's approach to sexuality, desire, representation, memory, and art."</p> (Michael Roth, President, Wesleyan University)<br><br><p>"<i>Mirrors of Memory</i> is an extraordinary interdisciplinary book, bringing together psychoanalysis, Freud's intellectual and emotional biography, the history of photography and its intellectual and popular reception, and the historiography of art. Mary Bergstein explores both Freud's work and the history of photography in depth and detail, with all their complexities and contradictions. Deeply scholarly and imaginatively researched, each chapter is a gem, and each page is thoroughly engrossing. In exploring all dimensions of Freud&#x2019;s visual imagination, it literally and figuratively opened my eyes to images and possibilities of which I had only been dimly aware."</p> (Bennett Simon, MD, Harvard Medical School (Cambridge Health Alliance), Training and Supervising Analyst, Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, and author of <i>Mind and Madness in Ancient Greece: The Classical Roots of Modern Psychiatry</i>)</p><h2>The Varieties of Religious Experience</h2><p>First-rate study of spirituality documents and discusses a variety of religious states of consciousness, covering the meaning of the term &#34;divine,&#34; reality of the unseen, religion of healthy-mindedness, sick soul, divided self and process of its unification, conversion, saintliness, and mysticism. Studded with richly concrete examples; a classic of its genre.</p><p><i>"I am neither a theologian, nor a scholar learned in the history of religions, nor an anthropologist. Psychology is the only branch of learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the religious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other of the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem, therefore, as a psychologist, the natural thing for me would be to invite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities."</i> <p> When William James went to the University of Edinburgh in 1901 to deliver a series of lectures on "natural religion," he defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine." Considering religion, then, not as it is defined by--or takes place in--the churches, but as it is felt in everyday life, he undertook a project that, upon completion, stands not only as one of the most important texts on psychology ever written, not only as a vitally serious contemplation of spirituality, but for many critics one of the best works of nonfiction written in the 20th century. Reading <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, it is easy to see why. Applying his analytic clarity to religious accounts from a variety of sources, James elaborates a pluralistic framework in which "the divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities, by being champions of which in alternation, different men may all find worthy missions." It's an intellectual call for serious religious tolerance--indeed, respect--the vitality of which has not diminished through the subsequent decades.</p>"<b>The Varieties of Religious Experience</b> is certainly the most notable of all books in the field of the psychology of religion and probably destined to be the most influential [one] written on religion in the twentieth century," said Walter Houston Clark in <b>Psychology Today</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book was an immediate bestseller upon its publication in June 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the pluralistic views of psychologist-turned-philosopher William James, it posits that individual religious experiences, rather than the tenets of organized religions, form the backbone of religious life.&nbsp;&nbsp;James's discussion of conversion, repentance, mysticism, and hope of reward and fears of punishment in the hereafter--as well as his observations on the religious experiences of such diverse thinkers as Voltaire, Whitman, Emerson, Luther, Tolstoy, and others--all support his thesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;"James's characteristic humor, his ability to put down the pretentious and to be unpretentious, and his willingness to take some risks in his choices of ancedotal data or provocative theories are all apparent in the book," noted Professor Martin E. Marty.&nbsp;&nbsp;"A reader will come away with more reasons to raise new questions than to feel that old ones have been resolved."</p><h2>Making of the West, Volume II: Since 1500: Peoples and Cultures</h2><p>Students of Western civilization need more than facts.

Arguing that African Americans use community dialogue to jointly develop understandings of their collective political interests, Harris-Lacewell identifies four political ideologies that constitute the framework of contemporary black political thought: Black Nationalism, Black Feminism, Black Conservatism and Liberal Integrationism. These ideologies, the book posits, help African Americans to understand persistent social and economic inequality, to identify the significance of race in that inequality, and to devise strategies for overcoming it.</p></p><p>Winner of the 2005 Best Book Award, Racial and Ethnic Political Identities, Ideologies and Theories Category of the Race, Ethnicity, and Politics Section, American Political Science Association. <p>Co-Winner of the 2005 W.E.B.

It is an anthem to human cleverness, and it is a vivid reminder of what we are capable of when we choose to follow leaders with courage and vision.</p><p>Imagine a version of <i>The Right Stuff</i> whose protagonists are engineers rather than cocky test pilots-turned-astronauts. Author Mike Gray gives a gripping account of the men who led the North American Aviation Company through one of the largest and most daunting engineering projects in history, the development of the S-2 rocket engine, and the Apollo spacecraft. Filled both with detailed technical background and explorations of the psyches who drove--and were sometimes crushed by--the race to the moon, <i>Angle of Attack</i> offers a captivating look at the monumental accomplishments of a bygone era.Mike Gray (1935&#x2015;2013) was an engineer, screenwriter, and author.

In fact, she supposed she had never once in her score and three years of life considered such a thing. Her life, she would be the first to admit, was so near to perfection as to be indistinguishable from it. Her parents were kind and loving, her siblings very tolerable, and her surroundings magnificent. She had never once been beaten, never not had enough to eat or warm things to wear, never had anything terrible happen to her. Her life had been substantially less pleasant when she&#x2019;d been sent to market for fathers of potential husbands to look over, but that hadn&#x2019;t been her family&#x2019;s fault. In truth, she could have expected nothing less.</p><p>What she hadn&#x2019;t expected, however, was what a messenger had handed her but a handful of hours earlier, a missive she had the very unpleasant feeling would completely change the course of her life&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re thinking very hard.&#x201d;</p><p>She closed her eyes briefly when she realized her twin brother, Miles, was standing next to her. She wondered if she&#x2019;d said anything aloud in her distress, then decided the best thing to do was attack before Miles thought too much about what she might or might not have said.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis good for the faculties to engage in robust thought now and again,&#x201d; she said briskly. &#x201c;You might give it a try.&#x201d;</p><p>He only leaned back against the wall casually. &#x201c;I would, but don&#x2019;t want to hurt myself. You, however, seem to have little fear of the same. Would you care to divulge what strengthens your robust faculties at the moment?&#x201d;</p><p>As if she would trust him with her current thoughts! Miles was a vault when it came to the hearing of secrets guaranteed to produce a swoon in those with a less sturdy stomach, true, but to reveal the contents of the missive she had just received would be too much for his ironclad belly.</p><p>She glanced at him to find that he was still studying her with undue scrutiny.</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t thinking about anything,&#x201d; she protested.</p><p>He shot her a skeptical look.</p><p>&#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; she said, desperate to get him to go away. &#x201c;I was thinking about how much I love my family. Why don&#x2019;t you go sit with them over by the fire and allow me to think kind thoughts about you as well?&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged slightly. &#x201c;You looked as though you might need aid in your latest plot. How could I not offer my services?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Plot,&#x201d; she repeated, wishing she&#x2019;d been able to add to that what might sound more like a careless laugh than a sick sort of quack better suited to a duck preparing to have a final waddle before winding up on a spit. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not plotting.&#x201d;</p><p>Miles only lifted an eyebrow briefly, then smiled and leaned his head back against the wall. Isabelle attempted to imitate his pose, but the best she could do was wrap her arms around herself and try not to shiver as she looked out at the group of souls clustered there in front of her. She could bring innumerable evenings to mind where the family had either gathered where they were currently in the great hall or in a more intimate setting in their sire&#x2019;s solar. If anything happened to them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </p><p>She pulled herself away from that thought before it got away from her and blossomed into a panic she truly couldn&#x2019;t control. She took a deep breath, then considered her family in a measured, detached fashion.</p><p>Robin was there with his wife, Anne, and their two spawn. Amanda was there as well with her husband, Jackson the Fourth, along with their daughter and newborn son, Jackson the Fifth. She herself was there with Miles, of course, which was perhaps rarer than she would have cared for. Miles tended to have itchy feet, which kept him always looking for the next adventure.</p><p>Her younger brothers, John and Montgomery, were also there, freshly knighted and looking particularly happy to be sitting sprawled in chairs before the fire. Well, Montgomery looked happy. John looked as if he might be plotting something. Then again, of late John always looked as if he were considering things he shouldn&#x2019;t have been. Dangerous things.</p><p>She understood that, as it happened.</p><p>The only ones missing were Nicholas and Jennifer, who were currently at Nicholas&#x2019;s keep in France, Beauvois, awaiting the birth of their second son. Her mother planned to travel to France soon to be of use to her daughter-in-law. Robin would stay at Artane with his family, no doubt, to see to their father&#x2019;s affairs, but it was very likely that the rest of the family would find itself in France to celebrate Nicky and Jennifer&#x2019;s new child. All in close proximity.</p><p>An interesting coincidence, that, to be sure.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wheezing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I spent too much time in the stables today,&#x201d; Isabelle answered without hesitation. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s entirely possible I sniffed too much hay.&#x201d;</p><p>It was also possible that the thought of her family being together in France in the near future was enough to leave her unable to breathe. How much easier life had been when she and her siblings had been young and innocent and heedless of any potential danger. She sighed.</p><p>&#x201c;Why must things change?&#x201d;</p><p>She wished she could take the words back the moment she said them, but it was too late. She looked reluctantly at Miles to find him studying her too closely for her comfort. Indeed, he had turned to face her, leaning his shoulder against the stone.</p><p>&#x201c;Time is a river you cannot stop,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;All you can do is navigate it as best you can.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I might have an opinion on where my boat is going.&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t look at all surprised, which made her wonder if perhaps she should be more discreet about allowing her thoughts to show on her face.</p><p>&#x201c;And are you considering manning the tiller?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; she said, trying to put just the right amount of firmness in her tone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just babbling. Besides, where would I go?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps a better question is, where would you go if you could filch a horse and be on your way without having to ask permission?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My only destination is the fire across the hall where I might sit with my family and enjoy the evening.&#x201d;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t seem inclined to lead the way. &#x201c;You know I won&#x2019;t say anything to anyone,&#x201d; he remarked mildly. &#x201c;If you cared to unburden yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>Which, she had to concede, was the absolute truth. If there were anyone alive she could trust with her most appalling secrets, it would be Miles. She suppressed the urge to look around her to see if she were being eavesdropped on, paused, then gave in to the impulse. She glanced about her whilst trying not to look as if she were glancing about herself. Then she looked at her brother, just to see if he looked at all queasy.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t, damn him anyway.</p><p>She, however, felt profoundly ill. It wasn&#x2019;t that she wasn&#x2019;t used to a fair amount of scheming. She was a de Piaget lass, after all, and her mother and older sister were famous for their plots and schemes, things that were discussed regularly and with great enthusiasm. By the ladies of the hall, at least. Her father tended to close his eyes briefly, breathe carefully a time or two, then find something requiring his immediate attention elsewhere when faced with a retelling of those tales. Her brothers simply shook their heads, as if they were unequal to expressing their admiration for deeds accomplished.</p><p>She paused. Well, perhaps that wasn&#x2019;t entirely accurate. Her eldest brother, Robin, tended to roll his eyes and summarily dismiss any of the truly noteworthy pieces of mischief his female relatives had combined. Her next oldest brother, Nicholas, was wont to simply walk away without comment. Miles generally smiled indulgently, whilst her next youngest brother, John, would never stand still long enough to hear the successful resolution of the adventure. Her youngest brother, Montgomery, was the one who shivered violently at any retelling, though she had the feeling that it was less out of admiration than it was sheer terror. Then again, he had been in the thick of more of their plots than he likely cared to think on.</p><p>That was definitely something to remember, should the need for a willing participant in a plot arise.</p><p>&#x201c;Iz?&#x201d;</p><p>She took a deep breath. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking about an adventure.&#x201d;</p><p>There, that sounded reasonable. It sounded a far sight more reasonable than telling him that she&#x2019;d received a missive addressed to her specifically that instructed her to find a way to present herself immediately at a particular abbey in France or her grandparents&#x2019; lives would be the forfeit. She&#x2019;d been so stunned first by the fact that anyone would know her name that she&#x2019;d hardly had the presence of mind to ask who had engaged the messenger. The man had said he&#x2019;d simply been handed the missive by someone in York who had paid him very handsomely for his services&#x2014;</p><p>&#x201c;Does this adventure involve a boat?&#x201d;</p><p>She looked at her brother to find him smiling faintly at her, as if he thought to tease her for her plans. She took a deep breath.</p><p>&#x201c;It might, actually.&#x201d;</p><p>His smile faded abruptly. &#x201c;You cannot be serious.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you were merely listening, not commenting.&#x201d;</p><p>He shut his mouth that had fallen open. &#x201c;So I was. Go ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>Isabelle suppressed the urge to shift. Miles would notice that and know that she was being slightly less than frank.</p><p>&#x201c;I was thinking I might make a little journey,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;To see a relative or two.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Not in England.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; he said, and no doubt he did. &#x201c;Whilst I&#x2019;m always eager to make a journey, I wonder why&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re seeking an adventure not in England&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t wait and be about your business with Mother and her enormous guard?&#x201d; He looked at her pointedly. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be going to France in a month, as I&#x2019;m sure you already know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Isabelle said, waving her hand about in what she hoped was an airy, careless fashion. &#x201c;I thought it might be interesting to make a journey alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To France,&#x201d; he said carefully.</p><p>&#x201c;It has been done before.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked almost&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unsettled, which for Miles was rather unsettling indeed. &#x201c;Isabelle,&#x201d; he said, using her entire name, which for him was also rather unusual, &#x201c;you cannot simply traipse about the wilds of England and France by yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;You do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am not the stunning youngest daughter of Rhys de Piaget.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t ugly, Miles,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Not entirely.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled and even she, who had more than ample memories of just how awful he&#x2019;d been as a lad of ten, had to admit he was quite possibly the most handsome of her parents&#x2019; sons, damn him anyway.</p><p>&#x201c;I have a sword,&#x201d; he noted.</p><p>&#x201c;I could find a sword.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know how to use mine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you think I couldn&#x2019;t manage the same?&#x201d; she said archly.</p><p>He turned, leaned his back against the wall, and rubbed his hands over his face. &#x201c;Iz, I don&#x2019;t doubt there are many things you could do if you set your mind to it,&#x201d; he said with a sigh, &#x201c;but hefting a sword isn&#x2019;t one of them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve watched you lads in the lists often enough. And Amanda can use a sword. Why can&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;</p><p>He shot her a look. &#x201c;Because you haven&#x2019;t the temperament of your older sister who would just as soon stab me as to look at me if I vexed her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t need a sword,&#x201d; she said confidently. &#x201c;I thought I would go in disguise.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you did.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As a lad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think anyone will notice me.&#x201d;</p><p>Miles looked at her, then laughed. &#x201c;Believe that if you want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A little dirt here, a smudge there, and voil�,&#x201d; she said firmly. &#x201c;A lad too uninteresting to bother with.&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;I imagine it would take a bit more than dirt to hide who you are to any but the most witless of men, but we&#x2019;ll argue that point later. I still don&#x2019;t understand why you can&#x2019;t simply wait for Mother and go in her company.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I need an adventure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then cast caution to the wind and ride to the shore when it threatens rain.&#x201d;</p><p>She would have glared at him, but the missive she&#x2019;d shoved down the front of her gown was burning her like a handful of live coals. If she didn&#x2019;t do what she&#x2019;d been instructed to do, her entire family would die. Wasn&#x2019;t that what had been said? She was to present herself in France, at the abbey at Caours, and not tell anyone why she was doing so. Her family would perish, or so the missive said, if any but she arrived. Details about her parents and siblings had been provided, details that could have only come from someone who had either observed her family closely or knew someone who had.</p><p>She looked down her nose at her brother. &#x201c;I require a journey of slightly more substance than a trip to the shore. And I have it very well thought out, thank you very much.&#x201d;</p><p>His mouth worked for a moment or two, then he resorted to blinking at her as if he&#x2019;d never seen her before. &#x201c;But why?&#x201d;</p><p>Well, that was something at least that she absolutely couldn&#x2019;t tell him. She cast about for something plausible to say, which wasn&#x2019;t all that difficult. The truth was, she had been longing to have a change of locale for some time, for very particular reasons. She turned to face him.</p><p>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;m tired of being merely the one who&#x2019;s left.&#x201d;</p><p>He frowned. &#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s what they call me,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The fathers who come here looking for a wife for their sons. They come for Amanda, apparently unable to reconcile themselves to the fact that she&#x2019;s been wed for four years. Once they can no longer deny that Amanda is not for sale, they look around in consternation. After that&#x2014;without fail&#x2014;they announce that they&#x2019;ll settle for the one who&#x2019;s left.&#x201d; She lifted her chin. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t even know my name.&#x201d;</p><p>He winced. &#x201c;Oh, Iz&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And that, Miles, is why I want to make a journey on my own. So someone at some point in the future will know my name, even if it&#x2019;s merely to associate it with an ill-advised adventure.&#x201d;</p><p>He reached out, slung his arm around her shoulders, and pulled her into a quick embrace. Then he pulled away, put both hands on her shoulders, and looked at her seriously.</p><p>&#x201c;The ones who matter know who you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unfortunately, they are not the ones presenting themselves at the gates and offering to take my dowry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Father isn&#x2019;t forcing you to wed, is he?&#x201d; Miles asked.</p><p>&#x201c;You know he isn&#x2019;t, but that hardly matters. I&#x2019;m a score and three. Too old to be home and a burden to my parents.&#x201d;</p><p>He shot her a look of disbelief. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t believe they feel that way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I feel that way.&#x201d; She shrugged his hands off her shoulders and wrapped her arms around herself. &#x201c;I know I&#x2019;ll have to wed eventually, and I suppose I must needs wed someone who doesn&#x2019;t know my name, but perhaps I could have at least a few days to myself.&#x201d; She looked at him. &#x201c;Before I give up my freedom.&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m enormously glad I&#x2019;m not a woman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So am I. I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to filch your clothes otherwise.&#x201d;</p><p>He scowled at her briefly, then laughed apparently in spite of himself. &#x201c;My clothes are far too big for you. I think even Montgomer...</p></p><h2>Assessment of Aphasia and Related Disorders</h2><p>The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination Set is a group of eight prod ucts that helps clinicians distinguish among neurologically recognized aphasic syndromes.

She's been Hunting these monsters since she was a child, and has a pack of eleven fiercely protective magical Hounds. Then the rules change. Monsters unlike any Joy's ever seen or even heard of are breaking through Apex City's barriers and the Hunters are scrambling to find new ways to fight them--all the while hiding the true danger Apex faces from the Cits, who are ignorant of the severity of the Othersiders' attacks. <br>The leaders of Apex must come together to protect the city, but tensions have never been higher between the Hunters and the powerful PsiCorps, with each group competing to be the primary protector of the city. The conflict escalates even further when Joy starts discovering bodies of Psimons while patrolling the city sewers--on a special assignment from her uncle, who commands the Hunters. Someone is killing Psimons and if Joy doesn't uncover the true culprit she might just take the fall for it. <br>Chaos erupts when Ace, the murderous Hunter who tried to kill Joy at her Elite trials, escapes from the Army's captivity and defects to the Othersiders. Joy has no idea what Ace might be capable of with the help of the cunning Folk, but she may be about to find out; Othersider forces are gaining strength and momentum just beyond the barriers. A storm is approaching Apex City, and unless Joy and her fellow Hunters put up the fight of their lives it might just sweep them all away? <br></p><p><b>Mercedes Lackey</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling American fantasy author behind the Heralds of Valdemar series, the Elemental Masters series, the 500 Kingdoms series, and many more.

Concentrating on developments in Europe and North America from the Industrial Revolution to the present, he surveys the ways in which new materials, methods, and systems were discovered and tested, and the ways in which they succeeded or failed.<br> <br> Elliott tells the story in two parts, first covering materials - in chapters on wood, masonry, terracotta, iron and steel, glass, cement, and reinforced concrete - and then systems - including lightning protection, sanitation, lighting, heating, air conditioning, elevators and escalators, fire protection, structural engineering, and acoustics. Each chapter begins with a review of the relevant classical and medieval technology, then focuses on developments over the past two centuries, including related business, political, scientific, or social events where these impinge on development or usage.<br> <br> <i>Technics and Architecture </i>brings together information on a broad range of building materials and systems not found in any existing publication. It identifies the principles underlying technical advances in the building arts, pointing out that significant innovations have depended largely on the discovery of new approaches to the problems rather than the polishing of old mechanisms or handcraft methods; that in most cases advances were more rapid when the urgency of development was imposed by uses outside the application of a material or system in buildings; and that the extent of improvements has been extremely uneven.<br> <br> Throughout, Elliott observes that at any specific time a variety of solutions are used simultaneously, according to industrial conditions and economic factors. This being a human activity, he notes, failures, equivocation, misjudgment, and vainglorious acts also play a part.<br> <br> Cecil D.

Created via tectonic plate movements and accretionary events, the original terranes were subsequently covered by sedimentary layers, ash, lavas, and glacial debris. These processes, begun millions of years ago, continue to affect the area, as seen in the eruption of Mount St. Helens and catastrophic Japanese tsunamis created by earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest. Understanding of the region&#39;s geology has led to new insight in volcanic eruption prediction, disaster preparedness, the environmental effects of mining, and urban development as it relates to geologic hazards. The Orrs&#39; detailed and informative writing style appeals to those with geologic training as well as beginners with an interest in the region. Each chapter covers a specific subregion, allowing for maximum flexibility both in the classroom and for the casual reader. The authors&#39; central theme that continental plate tectonics are the fundamental processes of Northwest geologic history permeates throughout the book.</p><p>&#34;The clarity of the material presented and the depth is excellent.

Reflecting the hands-on experience of children blowing soap bubbles, this volume from the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science series will answer some questions about bubbles, while raising many more. The simple, child-friendly discussion considers how soap bubbles are formed, what shape they take, and why they pop, as well as why bubbles in liquids such as water, juice, and milk, act differently. The book ends with two pages on making bubble solution and experimenting with bubbles. Illustrated entirely with photographs, the text doesn't try to explain everything about bubbles, but invites the child to consider what's happening. Miller's clear, well-composed pictures show young children engaged in bubble play and experimentation. The multicultural casting gives the presentation an inclusive, inviting look. One thing seems sure: parents and teachers reading this book aloud should be prepared for some bubble play when the book is done. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br> &nbsp;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i>&nbsp;(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br> &nbsp;<br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than thirty years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.&nbsp;<br><br><p><b>John Ditsky</b>, professor emeritus at the University of Windsor, Ontario, has published four books on Steinbeck.</p></p><h2>Clarkes Commentary Volume 3 Matthew- Revelations</h2><p>Clarks Commentary&#39;s Volume 5 - Matthew to Revelations</p><p></p><h2>Clinical Guidelines for Advanced Practice Nursing</h2><p>Clinical Guidelines for Advanced Practice Nursing: An Interdisciplinary Approach, Third Edition is an accessible and practical reference designed to help nurses and students with daily clinical decision making.

Search no further." --Martin Amis, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i><p> Originally published in 1953, Saul Bellow's modern picaresque tale grandly illustrates twentieth-century man's restless pursuit of an elusive meaning. Augie March, a young man growing up in Chicago during the Great Depression, doesn't understand success on other people's terms. Fleeing to Mexico in search of something to fill his restless soul and soothe his hunger for adventure, Augie latches on to a wild succession of occupations until his journey brings him full circle. Yet beneath Augie's carefree nature lies a reflective person with a strong sense of responsibility to both himself and others, who in the end achieves a success of his own making. A modern-day Columbus, Augie March is a man searching not for land but for self and soul and, ultimately, for his place in the world.</p><p> "A book of extraordinary and massive power ... plainly one of the richest of twentieth-century American novels." --Alfred Kazin</p><p> "[Bellow's] body of work is more capacious of imagination and language than anyone else's....

In this longitudinal case study, McElroy introduces readers to four Baffin Island communities in the eastern Canadian Arctic and focuses on the challenges and hardships they face in transition from hunting-gathering lifestyles to wage employment and political participation in towns. Through long-term fieldwork, historical material, and life histories collected from elders, <i>Nunavut Generations</i> richly illustrates political and ecological change alongside native stability and self-determination.</p><p>"This is an outstanding examination of Nunavumiut sociocultural dynamics through the last fifty years. McElroy skillfully blends elements of her own research (and personal experiences) with a critical overview of the social, economic, and political developments affecting Inuit in the late twentieth century. This work captures the nuances, as well as the `facts,' leading up to and during the creation of Nunavut." -- George Wenzel, McGill University <p>"An erudite book on the process of doing ethnographic research and the nature of interactions with people in the field. Excellent for students with no prior research experience." -- Wanni Anderson, Brown University</p>"<i>Nunavut Generations</i> has a great deal to offer students of Inuit studies and is a suitable ethnography for a broad range of courses, including introductory anthropology and peoples and cultures of the Circumpolar North. In addition to being clearly written, McElroy's text exposes the trials and tribulations of anthropological research. The fieldwork stories interspersed throughout the text are both poignant and inspirational. As is the case with the recent history of Nunavut, so it is true of cultural anthropology in general: both are journeys fraught with unanticipated challenges and unexpected opportunities." --Edmund Searles, <i>Etudes/Inuit/Studies</i><br><br>"Excellent 'return' ethnography that focuses accurately on major issues facing contemporary Inuit in the 21st century. From the writing, the depth of knowledge, and relationships McElroy has with community members and concern for their well-being reflects the very best of ethnographic work that we wish to portray to our students." --Kristen Borre, Northern Illinois University</p><h2>Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable (3 Vols. in 1)</h2><p>The first English edition of this magnificent textbook, translated from Russian, was published in three substantial volumes of 459, 347, and 374 pages, respectively. In this second English edition all three volumes have been put together with a new, combined index and bibliography. Some corrections and revisions have been made in the text, primarily in Volume II. Volumes II and III contain numerous references to the earlier volumes, so that the reader is reminded of the exact statements (and proofs) of the more elementary results made use of. The three-volume-in-one format makes it easy to flip back the pages, refresh one&#39;s memory, and proceed. The proofs chosen are those that give the student the best `feel&#39; for the subject. The watchword is clarity and straightforwardness. The author was a leading Soviet function-theorist: It is seldom that an expert of his stature puts himself so wholly at the service of the student. This book includes over 150 illustrations and 700 exercises.</p><p>Text: English, Russian (translation)This one-volume approach allows the book to be used for several different types of courses (elementary or more advanced) and makes it an excellent reference work in the field ... Theorems are presented in a logical way and are carefully proved, making this a most useful book for students. ---- Choice</p><h2>Adrian: A Lifetime of Movie Glamour, Art and High Fashion</h2><p><b>From ruby slippers to fashion runways, <i>Adrian: A Lifetime of Movie Glamour, Art and High Fashion</i> is a visual celebration of the life and work of the man behind some of the most memorable fashions of Hollywood's golden age.</b><br><br>This book is a bright and vivacious look at the fashion, art and homes of one of the most celebrated fashion designers of the twentieth century. Adrian (1903-1959) designed costumes for over 150 Hollywood productions, including fabulous gowns worn by such iconic actresses as Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Judy Garland, and Katharine Hepburn. He then went on to found one of the most popular and influential fashion labels of the mid-twentieth century, Adrian, Ltd. He had a passion for art and interior design, as seen in his impeccably decorated homes, which he shared with his wife, Hollywood movie star Janet Gaynor, and his personal paintings and sketches.<br><br>The man who created the famous ruby slippers worn in The Wizard of Oz was also the first American designer honored with a retrospective at the Smithsonian Institution, and his influence can still be felt on the runways in New York and Paris today. This is the first book on the famed Hollywood fashion and costume designer to be published with the cooperation of his family. With a foreword by the designer's son, Robin, as well as a treasure trove of never-before-seen images and anecdotes taken from Adrian's unpublished manuscript, this is the definitive book on the life of the legendary designer.</p><p><b>Leonard Stanley</b> is the preeminent collector of sketches by many of Hollywood's most famous costume designers, including Adrian.<br><b>Robin Adrian </b>is the son of Gilbert Adrian and Janet Gaynor.<br><b>Mark.

Discovered there, circa 1887, were nearly four hundred cuneiform tablets containing correspondence of the Egyptian court with rulers of neighboring states in the mid-fourteenth century B.C. Previous translations of these letters were both incomplete and reflected an imperfect understanding of the Babylonian dialects in which they were written. William Moran devoted a lifetime of study to the Amarna letters to prepare this authoritative English translation.</p><p>The letters provide a vivid record of high-level diplomatic exchanges that, by modern standards, are often less than diplomatic. An Assyrian ruler complains that the Egyptian king's latest gift of gold was not even sufficient to pay the cost of the messengers who brought it. The king of Babylon refuses to give his daughter in marriage to the pharaoh without first having proof that the king's sister -- already one of the pharaoh's many wives -- is still alive and well. The king of Karaduniyash complains that the Egyptian court has "detained" his messenger -- for the past six years. And Egyptian vassal Rib-Hadda, writing from the besieged port of Byblos, repeatedly demands military assistance for his city or, failing that, an Egyptian ship to permit his own escape.</p></p><p>"The acknowledged master of these texts is William Moran, who produced a complete re-edition of the tablets, in French, in 1987. The Amarna Letters is a revised version of this, done into English. Open it, and hear these voices from a vanished empire speak after three and a half millennia."&#x2014;Times Literary Supplement<p>William L. Moran (1921-2000) was Andrew W.

One of the guests tells about a governess at a country house plagued by supernatural visitors. But in the hands of Henry James, the master of nuance, this little tale of terror is an exquisite gem of sexual and psychological ambiguity. Only the young governess can see the ghosts; only she suspects that the previous governess and her lover are controlling the two orphaned children (a girl and a boy) for some evil purpose. The household staff don't know what she's talking about, the children are evasive when questioned, and the master of the house (the children's uncle) is absent. Why does the young girl claim not to see a perfectly visible woman standing on the far side of the lake? Are the children being deceptive, or is the governess being paranoid? By leaving the questions unanswered, <i>The Turn of Screw</i> generates spine-tingling anxiety in its mesmerized readers.Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Many efforts to improve therapy have focused on codifying evidence-based treatments, but in doing so have left the psychotherapeutic relationship behind. Clinical experience and research findings underscore that the therapeutic relationship accounts for as much of the outcome as particular treatments.

Eliot A modernist classic, Ulysses is without doubt one of the great masterpieces of the twentieth century. The novel follows the interwoven paths of the young schoolteacher Stephen Dedalus, bitterly estranged from his father, and the middle-aged Dubliner, Leopold Bloom, still grieving for his dead infant son. Over the course of twenty-four hours, their unwitting quest for each other -- surrogate son for surrogate father -- is enacted against an extraordinary, celebratory portrait of the city of Dublin.</p><p><i>Ulysses</i> has been labeled dirty, blasphemous, and unreadable. In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic book--although he found it sufficiently unobscene to allow its importation into the United States--and Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyce's "cloacal obsession." None of these adjectives, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains <i>the</i> modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even (in a close-focus sort of way) suspenseful. And despite the exegetical industry that has sprung up in the last 75 years, <i>Ulysses</i> is also a compulsively readable book. Even the verbal vaudeville of the final chapters can be navigated with relative ease, as long as you're willing to be buffeted, tickled, challenged, and (occasionally) vexed by Joyce's sheer command of the English language.<p> Among other things, a novel is simply a long story, and the first question about any story is: <i>What happens?</i>. In the case of <i>Ulysses</i>, the answer might be <i>Everything</i>. William Blake, one of literature's sublime myopics, saw the universe in a grain of sand. Joyce saw it in Dublin, Ireland, on June 16, 1904, a day distinguished by its utter normality. Two characters, Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom, go about their separate business, crossing paths with a gallery of indelible Dubliners. We watch them teach, eat, stroll the streets, argue, and (in Bloom's case) masturbate. And thanks to the book's stream-of-consciousness technique--which suggests no mere stream but an impossibly deep, swift-running river--we're privy to their thoughts, emotions, and memories. The result? Almost every variety of human experience is crammed into the accordian folds of a single day, which makes <i>Ulysses</i> not just an experimental work but the very last word in realism. </p><p> Both characters add their glorious intonations to the music of Joyce's prose. Dedalus's accent--that of a freelance aesthetician, who dabbles here and there in what we might call Early Yeats Lite--will be familiar to readers of <i>Portrait of an Artist As a Young Man</i>. But Bloom's wistful sensualism (and naive curiosity) is something else entirely. Seen through his eyes, a rundown corner of a Dublin graveyard is a figure for hope and hopelessness, mortality and dogged survival: "Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really?" --<i>James Marcus</i></p>The 1934 text, as corrected and reset in 1961. Ulysses is one of the most influential novels of the twentieth century. It was not easy to find a publisher in America willing to take it on, and when Jane Jeap and Margaret Anderson started printing extracts from the book their literary magazine The Little Review in 1918, they were arrested and charged with publishing obscenity. They were fined $100, and even The New York Times expressed satisfaction with their conviction. Ulysses was not published in book form until 1922, when another American woman, Sylvia Beach, published it in Paris for her Shakespeare &amp; Company. Ulysses was not available legally in any English-speaking country until 1934, when Random House successfully defended Joyce against obscenity charges and published it in the Modern Library. This edition follows the complete and unabridged text as corrected and reset in 1961. Judge John Woolsey's decision lifting the ban against Ulysses is reprinted, along with a letter from Joyce to Bennett Cerf, the publisher of Random House, and the original foreword to the book by Morris L. Ernst, who defended Ulysses during the trial.</p><h2>The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History, Volume I (Available Titles CourseMate)</h2><p>THE EARTH AND ITS PEOPLES presents world history in a balanced, global framework, shifting the focus away from political centers of power.

Everyone with an interest in psychoanalysis and the psychoanalytic movement will enjoy exploring, grappling with, arguing about, and learning from this absolutely fascinating book."-JUDITH VIORST, AUTHOR,<br> Necessary Losses and Imperfect Control "Written with brilliance and insight, Freud: Darkness in the Midst of Vision takes us on a daring, at times chilling, journey to the early years of psychoanalysis, revealing both the human weaknesses and the professional triumphs of its founder. . . . Cutting away the accretions of fabrication and romance cloaking Sigmund Freud, Breger has reinstated historical honesty to its rightful, high place, but the figure who emerges at the end of this breathlessly honest biography is quite as extraordinary as the legend concocted by Freud and perpetuated by his followers. Fresh, vigorous, and lucid."-PHILIP M. BROMBERG, Ph.D., CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY<br> "Louis Breger's fine new biography of Freud is a welcome contribution to the existing literature and a corrective to much of it. It is also one of the best intellectual histories of the origin and development of psychoanalysis I have read in recent years. Breger is to be commended for his original research, the objectivity of his views, and the elegance and grace of his writing."-DEIRDRE BAIR, NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER FOR Samuel Beckett AND AUTHOR OF A FORTHCOMING BIOGRAPHY OF CARL JUNG<br> "Finally, the Freud biography we have long been waiting for. With the history of Europe in the background, we follow with fascination Freud's journey from an impoverished childhood filled with losses to worldly fame, ending in exile in England. We come to understand the impact of Freud's difficult personality on the development of his brilliant as well as questionable theoretical ideas. Breger writes with compassion and fairness toward Freud as well as toward the many interesting personalities who cross his life, with their complicated relationships to the great man."-SOPHIE FREUD, FREUD'S GRANDDAUGHTER AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS OF SOCIAL WORK, SIMMONS COLLEGE<br> "Louis Breger's magnificent book is the definitive work on the personal psychology of Sigmund Freud. it brilliantly illuminates how the darkness in Freud's vision has affected psychoanalytic history. This book will be central for psychoanalytic scholarship for decades to come."-GEORGE E. ATWOOD, Ph.D., PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY, RUTGERS UNIVERSITY</p><p>Sigmund Freud, father of psychoanalysis, plunged into the dark regions of the human psyche-including his own-to reveal the truth about sexuality, neurosis, and the unconscious. Or so the legend has it. In this perceptive biography, Louis Breger presents a striking new portrait of one of the great figures of the twentieth century, showing how Freud systematically obscured the truth about his life to create a heroic image of himself that was a blend of fact and fantasy.<br> <br> In his youth, Freud's family lived on the edge of poverty in anti-Semitic Vienna. His mother was a demanding and controlling woman and his father a weak and failed man. Young Sigmund escaped from all these unbearable conditions into the world of books and his imagination, where he sought solace and consolation in fantasies of the ancient world. He was drawn to powerful conquerors-Oedipus, Alexander the Great, Hannibal, Napol�on-and longed for the day when he could achieve fame and power, when he could become, in his own words, a "hero." The boy who had lived in a fantasy world became an impressive prose stylist, capable of presenting his often controversial ideas in compelling ways. He used his formidable skills to shape both his personal legend and the history of the psychoanalytic movement. Out of his self-analysis and work with patients came his seminal contributions: the unconscious, the significance of dreams, the formative influence of early emotional experience, and psychoanalysis as a form of therapy.<br> <br> But he could see only so much about himself, and his blindness to the pain, fear, and helplessness of his early years led him to create a myth about his childhood-centered on the Oedipus complex-that obscured the sources of his adult anxiety, symptoms, and addictions. From this came the overblown theories, the neglect of trauma and real-life experience, the distorted views of women, and the authoritarian form of treatment, all of which have plagued psychoanalysis since its inception. Breger's insightful portrait reveals Freud as a man of striking contradictions, someone whose startling originality coexisted with a rigid adherence to dogma, a person who spent his life immersed in the most intimate details of other people's lives yet remained wrapped up in himself and curiously remote from others, a man of deep insights who was also blind to the effect he had on other people. In demythologizing Freud, Breger penetrates to the "darkness" behind one of the brightest minds of the twentieth century.LOUIS BREGER is Professor of Psychoanalytic Studies, Emeritus, at the California Institute of Technology and founding President of the Institute of Contemporary Psychoanalysis. He has been a practicing psychotherapist/psychoanalyst for over thirty-five years and has published numerous scholarly articles and books dealing with dreams, personality development, literary interpretation, and psychoanalytic theory.</p><h2>Pomodoro!: A History of the Tomato in Italy (Arts and Traditions of the Table: Perspectives on Culinary History)</h2><p>More than just the beloved base ingredient of so many of our favorite dishes, the tomato has generated both profound riches and controversy in its farming, processing, exchange, and consumption. It is a crop infused with national pride and passion for those who grow it, and a symbol of Old World nostalgia for those who claim its history and legacy. <br><br>Over time, the tomato has embodied a range of values and meanings. From its domestication in Central America, it has traveled back and forth across the Atlantic, powering a story of aspiration and growth, agriculture and industry, class and identity, and global transition. In this entertaining and organic history, David Gentilcore recounts the surprising rise of the tomato from its New World origin to its Old World significance. From its inauspicious introduction into Renaissance Europe, the tomato came to dominate Italian cuisine and the food industry over the course of three centuries. <br><br>Gentilcore explores why elite and peasant cultures took so long to assimilate the tomato into Italian cooking and how it eventually triumphed. He traces the tomato's appearance in medical and agricultural treatises, travel narratives, family recipe books, kitchen accounts, and Italian art, literature, and film. He focuses on Italy's fascination with the tomato, painting a larger portrait of changing trends and habits that began with botanical practices in the sixteenth century and attitudes toward vegetables in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and concluded with the emergence of factory production in the nineteenth. Gentilcore continues with the transformation of the tomato into a national symbol during the years of Italian immigration and Fascism and examines the planetary success of the "Italian" tomato today, detailing its production, representation, and consumption.</p><p><p>The dish on the world's most iconic food.</p>David Gentilcore is professor of early modern history at the University of Leicester. He has written widely on the social and cultural history of Italy, from popular religion to the practices of medicine and healing.

Cooper has literally been on the cutting edge of medicine, having been a member of the team that performed the first successful heart transplants in the United Kingdom, and overseeing the heart transplant program at the University of Cape Town Medical School in South Africa, working under Dr. Christiaan Barnard. <i>Open Heart</i> tells the story behind the amazing advances in cardiovascular medicine as performed by the maverick doctors who strived to perfect them. Having interviewed many of the greatest heart surgeons in person during the past 20 years, this book benefits from the emption and excitement of these surgeons' own words. These men affect everyday lives even more than the early astronauts, who, like these surgeons, had &#x201c;the right stuff.&#x201d; But who were they? What drove them to perform the feats they did? Beginning with Claudius Galen, second century A.D. physician to Emperor Marcus Aurelius, and his observations of fallen gladiators, to the major 20th century innovators, <i>Open Heart</i> tells the stories and highlights from the careers of the greatest heart surgeons, including Christiaan Barnard, Denton Cooley, Michael Debakey, and many others. Because of these bold and brilliant physicians, blue babies no longer die at birth, young people can live well into old age, and damaged organs can be transplanted with healthy ones.</p><p>Dr. Cooper transforms himself as well, from heart surgeon (and colleague to many of the surgeons profiled in the book) to historian/storyteller as <i>Open Heart</i> portrays the remarkable doctors who have saved the lives of so many others.</p></p><p><b>David K.C. Cooper, MD, PhD, FRCS,</b> is a heart transplant surgeon and researcher. He completed his medical education at the University of London, then trained in general surgery and heart surgery in the U.K. with periods of research at Harvard, Cambridge, and London. In the late 1970s, he was a member of the team that performed the first successful series of heart transplants in the U.K. In 1980, Dr. Cooper was appointed to the faculty of the University of Cape Town Medical School in South Africa, where he had responsibility for the heart transplant program under Prof. Christiaan Barnard. In 1987 he moved to Oklahoma City, where he continued his work in heart transplantation and research, and later accepted a research appointment at Harvard Medical School. During this time, he began meeting the pioneer surgeons who make up the personalities profiled in his book,&nbsp;Open Heart. Dr. Cooper has published almost 500 medical and scientific papers and chapters, and has edited or co-edited six major textbooks. He holds three doctorate degrees, and is a fellow of both the Royal College of Surgeons of England and the American College of Surgeons. He is now director of a research group at the Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, where he also is a professor of surgery.Calling his book an "oral history," heart surgeon and author Cooper credits a handful of pioneers who have transformed heart surgery as we know it. From Robert Gross and Clarence Crafoord, founders of modern cardiovascular surgery, to the African-American operating room technician Vivien Thomas, a dropout who helped develop a lifesaving operation for oxygen-starved babies, the innovations chronicled here reveal the extraordinary spirits of more than two dozen exceptional men. Cooper, utilizing lengthy interviews with many of the doctors, recounts the breakthroughs with pride, awe, and just the right amount of "dish," such as when he tells of Floyd John Lewis, a "bohemian" doctor who performed the first open heart operation only to later walk away from medicine to become a writer and painter. C. Walton Lillehei, we're told, was a bold open heart surgeon but possessed such rotten financial skills that he nearly sank his career. In short, these pioneers are simultaneously average and exceptional and, in Cooper's careful hands, always accessible. (Oct.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

An essentially simple tale about the struggle and triumph of innocence reviled, Ursule Mirouet is characterized by that wealth of penetrating observation so readily associated with Balzac&#39;s work. The twin themes of redemption and rebirth are illuminated by a consistently passionate rejection of both philosophic and practical materialism in favour of love. In this case love is aided by supernatural intervention, which itself effectively illustrates Balzac&#39;s life-long fascination with the occult.</p><p>The son of a civil servant, Honor� de Balzac was born in 1799 in Tours, France.

You will see threats to world security emanating from such relatively minor powers as North Korea, Iran, and even Brazil, which has been contemplating its own nuclear development.</p> <p>Some of this is bad news. Some not. Change is often associated with problems, anxiety, and fear. It is also associated with challenge. It may also be associated with progress, improvement, and opportunity.</p> <p>Which is what this book is about. It is designed to help investors make the most of opportunities that lie within the United States and outside of the United States. Such opportunities include the usual&#x2014;stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and money market instruments. Such opportunities also include areas with which most investors remain relatively unfamiliar&#x2014;commodities, overseas bonds, foreign stocks, real estate&#x2013;related instruments, and investments in developing countries. You will learn where such opportunities lie, of excellent vehicles in which to invest, how to time your purchases and sales, and how to create well-diversified and balanced portfolios that are appropriate to your stage of life and financial situation. </p> <p>Perhaps even more important, you will learn how to contain and reduce risks associated with investing&#x2014;timing techniques, diversification strategies, ways of recognizing "bargain-basement" prices, and strategies for profiting from inflationary trends as well as from deflation.</p> <p><b>The Need for Active Management</b></p> <p>The need for investors to be informed and active in their own management has, if anything, been increasing and is likely to continue to increase in the future. Movements are already under way to delay and/or reduce retirement benefits that accrue from Social Security, which would remove a major economic prop for many families. In addition, there have been initiatives to "privatize" Social Security, to make the individual beneficiaries rather than the government responsible for the financial growth of their Social Security assets, mirroring the responsibility for decisions that many investors now make within their 401K and other retirement plans. Many areas of decision making and risk are likely to be transferred from the government to the individual. The consequences of uninformed investing may well prove considerable.</p> <p><b>Active, Informed, Self-Management</b></p> <p>The passive investor may place his investment capital into one or two well-known mutual funds, hoping for the long-term best. Perhaps he may rely on his stock brokerage to select his investment portfolio. In both cases, he is likely to be relying on management whose interests almost certainly lie with encouraging investor passivity, in promoting buy and hold strategies through thick and thin, and who, because of the large amount of capital and large numbers of investors under their management, will tend toward investing conformity. This approach may have been fine during the 1980s and 1990s, two outstanding decades for the stock market. It has not worked well since then and may or may not serve investor purposes in the future.</p> <p>The actively managing investor may seek information&#x2014;and even some guidance&#x2014;from many sources. Such investors, however, will process and evaluate such information themselves, will come to their own decisions, and will act based on long- and short-term plans for investment that are modified as new investment opportunities develop and as old ones recede. </p> <p>They will adapt a true management style, establishing long- and shorter-term investment objectives, balancing potential reward and risks, remaining flexible&#x2014;ready to change course if and when investment conditions change. They will learn and apply investment techniques that are useful in this regard.</p> <p>The purpose of this book is to help <i>you</i> become one of the <i>they</i>. </p> <p><b>How This Book Will Help</b></p> <p> <i>Opportunity Investing</i> has been structured to provide benefit to readers who have only limited inclination/time to monitor their investments and even more benefit to investors who are willing to put additional time and effort into their investment programs.</p> <p>The initial sections of <i>Opportunity Investing</i> show you a range of more familiar and basic investment areas, profit potentials and pitfalls, and strategies for constructing portfolios for greater returns at lower risk. We review which investments are likely to produce greater returns during periods of inflation and which during periods of deflation. You will learn where you can secure high levels of income commensurate with risk and the benefits of and strategies associated with diversification (including diversification by time, investment sector, and geography). You will learn how to select open- and closed-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) most likely to succeed and will be provided with a "starter portfolio" of the less than 1% of mutual funds that have met certain criteria for long-term excellence in performance. You will also learn how you can improve your investing performance considerably&#x2014;quite considerably&#x2014;by the application of just one investment technique alone.</p> <p>As the book progresses, more active and involved investors will learn general and investment-specific techniques of market timing&#x2014;which are designed to help you know when to enter the various investment arenas and when to hold assets in cash and cash equivalents. You will learn how to measure the relative strength of different investments so that your portfolio may be rebalanced to emphasize those areas that are performing the best while de-emphasizing investment areas that are underperforming. </p> <p>In short, you will first learn techniques designed to help you decide what to buy and how to structure your investment portfolio. This, alone, should improve your investment results. You will then learn when to invest and when to stand aside. This should further improve returns. </p> <p>We live in a world of change, of challenges, and of opportunity. Let's move along now to enter into that world!</p> <br> <p>� Copyright Pearson Education.

These outstanding pieces of jewelry and ritual objects offer a material record of vanishing ways of life. Used as portable forms of wealth, as personal adornment, and in religious practice, they represent a broad spectrum of cultures. The majority comes from the Himalayan region, including Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and Mongolia, and other pieces hail from Afghanistan, China, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.<br> &nbsp;<br> The catalogue showcases stunning works&#x2014;including delicate amulet boxes, other Tibetan Buddhist artifacts, and ornate Turkmen jewelry&#x2014;through dramatic photography undertaken specifically for this publication.

It is partly an historical survey of the central figures and themes of this tradition But it is also a philosophical defense of some of its leading ideas, viz., that beauty plays an integral role in life, that aesthetic pleasure is the perception of perfection, that aesthetic rules are inevitable and valuable. It shows that the criticisms of Kant and Nietzsche of this tradition are largely unfounded. The rationalist tradition deserves re-examination because it is of great historical significance, marking the beginning of modern aesthetics, art criticism, and art history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Frederick Beiser </strong>was educated at Oriel College Oxford (B.A. 1972-74) and Wolfson College Oxford (1975-1981).

Custer and the little-known circumstances that led to the Little Big Horn massacre. The book is unique in its abundant use of primary sources to document Custer's personal life, checkered military career, and final battle. Reedstrom's convincing and readable narrative describes the incidents of the famous debacle, which essentially occurred because of botched communications between Custer and Captain Frederick Benteen. Complementing the fast-paced text are many carefully selected letters, diary and journal entries, maps, and photographs, which mirror the realities of the hard lives of soldiers, women, and Indians. The author offers a fair retelling of the early-settlement atrocities that eventually led to the Little Big Horn campaign, and lucidly depicts the slaughter of pioneer families by renegade Cheyenne and Dakota tribes. This is a historical resource that will be heavily used by YAs interested in American military or Native American history.<br><i>Carol Beall, Immanuel Christian School, Springfield, VA</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Teaching Stories</h2><p>A veteran teacher leads the American classroom into the 21st Century.

This book tells the story of the nativity through the performance of a children&#x2019;s Christmas pageant. With adorable illustrations and simple storytelling, Engelbreit paints a wonderful picture of the night that Jesus was born.</p><p>A Night of Great Joy recalls that fateful night with wonder and awe. From the arrival of Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem to the gathering of many before the baby Jesus, this holiday treasure leads children through the tale of the birth of Jesus, guiding them with the star of Bethlehem.</p><p>Mary Engelbreit, New York Times bestselling illustrator of the blockbuster Christmas classic The Night Before Christmas, brings readers a new holiday picture book that&#x2019;s sure to become a family favorite.</p></p><p><p>Mary Engelbreit grew up studying the illustrations in the vintage storybooks of her mother&#x2019;s own childhood, and she developed a unique style that harkens back to those simpler times. Mary&#x2019;s distinctive images have made her a celebrity to millions, who eagerly snap up gift items, calendars, books, fabrics, and more. Mary&#x2019;s dearest wish has always been to illustrate for children. Her <em>New York Times</em> bestselling <em>The Night Before Christmas</em> is already part of the holiday tradition for families across the country.</p>On the title-page spread, a diverse group of children and their families enter a building hung with a large banner proclaiming &#x201c;Christmas Pageant.&#x201d; The rest of the book presents the traditional play as it unfolds on stage. The narration offers a simply worded version of the biblical story, following Mary and Joseph through Bethlehem to the stable where the child is born. Angels appear to the shepherds, who make their way to the stable, followed by the wise men. All kneel to worship the infant. Though there are no surprises in the text, the illustrations include a few unexpected and charming additions. Mary rides around Bethlehem in a little red wagon; the baby looks a lot like Raggedy Andy; and two shepherds have a tug-of- war struggle over a toy lamb. With the spotlight on the rounded forms of rosy-cheeked, costumed kids drawn in Engelbreit&#x2019;s signature style, this colorful picture book will please her adult fans while holding the interest of many children. --- Carolyn Phelan (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>A classic Sunday School Christmas pageant is acted out by a multiethnic cast of children in this Christmas offering in Englebreit's signature illustration style.The pageant begins with a little black girl as an angel reading the passage from Luke that announces that Jesus has been born. The text describes the traditional Nativity story as though a narrator were reading it, with the child performers coming on stage in costume as the story progresses. Mary is an Asian girl, and Joseph is a white boy with red hair and a fake brown beard. One of the wise men is black, and a chorus of angels includes several children of color. The children are dressed in charming costumes with appropriate details, and there are funny little incidents tucked into the illustrations, such as two shepherd girls playing tug of war with a toy sheep and a tiny cow asleep on stage at the conclusion. The girl playing the part of Mary uses a rag doll for baby Jesus, and the final page shows Mary hugging her doll tenderly under the shining star. Though almost every Christian Sunday school puts on a Christmas pageant, there are few picture books that cover this annual holiday event, especially titles accessible to preschoolers. Children preparing to be in a pageant will enjoy this, as will Engelbreit's many adult fans. (Picture book. 3-6) (<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br>An elementary-school Christmas pageant plays out with warm humor in Engelbreit&#x2019;s (The Night Before Christmas) holiday offering. The author&#x2019;s cherubic characters perform the Nativity story using rudimentary props that will trigger smiles: a robed Joseph with a comically fake beard pulls Mary in a red wagon outfitted with a donkey head, a rocking horse and a rubber duck keep watch in the stable, the newborn Jesus is a rag doll, and stuffed animals fill in for sheep. The narrative is a straightforward, pared-down version of the biblical tale, without dialogue, which leaves the pictures to showcase the children&#x2019;s personalities (two shepherds fight over a toy lamb, a prima donna&#x2019;s antics irk her fellow angels, and a costumed cow falls asleep as the Wise Men arrive). The Nativity tale is one of great things born out of humble circumstances, a theme that dovetails perfectly with the homespun staging of the children&#x2019;s production. Starred review on 10/1/16.

Absolutely essential for understanding Egyptian hieroglyphs.</p><p></p><h2>Religion without God</h2><p><p>In his last book, Ronald Dworkin addresses questions that men and women have asked through the ages: What is religion and what is God's place in it? What is death and what is immortality? Based on the 2011 Einstein Lectures, <i>Religion without God </i>is inspired by remarks Einstein made that if religion consists of awe toward mysteries which "manifest themselves in the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, and which our dull faculties can comprehend only in the most primitive forms," then, he, Einstein, was a religious person.</p><p>Dworkin joins Einstein's sense of cosmic mystery and beauty to the claim that value is objective, independent of mind, and immanent in the world. He rejects the metaphysics of naturalism--that nothing is real except what can be studied by the natural sciences. Belief in God is one manifestation of this deeper worldview, but not the only one. The conviction that God underwrites value presupposes a prior commitment to the independent reality of that value--a commitment that is available to nonbelievers as well. So theists share a commitment with some atheists that is more fundamental than what divides them. Freedom of religion should flow not from a respect for belief in God but from the right to ethical independence.</p><p>Dworkin hoped that this short book would contribute to rational conversation and the softening of religious fear and hatred. <i>Religion without God </i>is the work of a humanist who recognized both the possibilities and limitations of humanity.</p></p><p>Ronald Dworkin was Frank Henry Sommer Professor of Law and Philosophy at New York University.<b>Dworkin</b> offers a way into discussions of science and human spiritual endeavor that is actually engaging and interesting, not combative and dogmatic...Dworkin is keen to show that--even for people who call themselves atheist--there remains a sense or a value to the world which bears so much in common with attitudes we call religious or spiritual...What Dworkin pursues is insight into the core of what makes us human and how it might be grounded in something other than an idea of God.<br> (Adam Frank <i>NPR online</i> 2013-05-21)<br><br><b>Dworkin</b> claims a religious attitude that acknowledges two things. First, human life has objective meaning and importance. Second, the physical universe is something of intrinsic value and wonder. This broad and inclusive definition has a significant implication. Both theists and atheists can assent to it because it points to a shared, fundamental commitment that goes beyond their differences. In this sense, atheists can be religious, and religion does not necessarily require a god. Because religious atheists lack a god who legitimizes those values and both creates the physical universe and endows it with sublimity and beauty, they need an alternative explanation. To that end, Dworkin offers a metaphysics of value before exploring the relationship between beauty and physics. Although Dworkin does not embrace theism, his book is neither antitheistic nor pro-atheist. Rather, his novel definition of religion may serve as a way for theists and religious atheists to engage in constructive conversation. Both camps will benefit from reading Dworkin's engaging and philosophically rigorous analysis.<br> (Christopher McConnell <i>Booklist</i> 2013-10-01)<br><br>[<b>Dworkin</b>] shines a brighter light on the true meaning of religion than anything produced lately by defenders of the faith. By his own account, he was a religious man, but also an atheist. That paradox leads him both to a deeper sense of faith and to a fuller appreciation of what it means to disavow the divine.<br> (James Carroll <i>Boston Globe</i> 2013-09-16)<br><br>For years, the Christian Right has been arguing that secular humanism, an ethical and humanistic system of viewing the world without reference to God, should be considered a religion. Now, from the opposite direction, <b>Dworkin</b> argues the same. In his last book, the late Dworkin, an atheist, believes that atheists share with theists a strong ethical sensibility as well as an appreciation of aesthetics that opens them to a sense of awe and an experience of the sublime that is similar to religious transcendence...Dworkin's characteristically well-argued book raises many provocative questions worthy of further discussion.<br> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2013-10-07)<br><br><b>Ronald Dworkin</b>&#x2019;s profound and moving final book, now published posthumously, is unique among the works that he wrote throughout the decades of his extraordinarily creative life. Anyone who read Dworkin or heard him lecture knows that he possessed a brilliant and elegant mind, conceptually sophisticated, analytically astute, and always at the service of a moral, legal, and political cause. But this book is marked by a different tone and style. It does not present a set of arguments that aim at changing beliefs and convictions; instead it conveys a philosophical, even spiritual sensibility. Its ambition is to effect not a shift in any particular position but a transformation in the way we see the world and in the stance we take toward the most basic features of our existence. The incisive qualities of Dworkin&#x2019;s mind are evident in various arguments that appear throughout the book (especially in the chapter titled &#x201c;Religious Freedom,&#x201d; which examines the nature of the constitutional protection of religion), but the main endeavor of <i>Religion without God</i> is to convey an attitude--not so much to argue as to &#x2018;show,&#x2019; to set before the reader a certain philosophical temper and to share a particular stance...It is rare in the life of a philosopher that a set of detailed arguments can be transfigured into a fundamental stance toward the universe and the human moral realm. In such a moment, the articulation of the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts. <i>Religion without God</i> is an attempt to articulate such a stance. Its ambition and its achievement make it a deep and precious book. (Moshe Halbertal <i>New Republic</i> 2013-10-21)<br><br>The position taken in <i>Religion Without God</i> reflects a commitment to objective value that has been indispensable for <b>Dworkin</b>&#x2019;s broader jurisprudence. (Jeremy Waldron <i>The Guardian</i> 2013-11-30)<br><br>Essentially sidesteps the regular theist vs. atheist debate to argue something altogether original and refreshing: that the religious impulse is (a) widely shared and (b) much bigger than a belief in God...Convictions of value are the common glue of humanity, <b>Dworkin</b> writes, and this idea is so appealing and so thoughtfully rendered in <i>Religion Without God</i>, that it is hard to find any fault with his logic...[It] inexorably lays out in lucid terms Dworkin&#x2019;s moral philosophy. The logical argument he makes is itself an example of the sort of inevitable beauty he describes...Dworkin reveals the profound humanism that has informed his life&#x2019;s work. He believes, tenaciously, that there is objective ethical and moral truth, &#x2018;a right way to live&#x2019; that is independent of theistic assumptions, and therefore available to religious atheists.

Out of their cleverness, the pigs Napoleon, Squealer, and Snowball emerge as leaders of the new community in a subtle evolution that proves disastrous. The climax is the brutal betrayal of the faithful horse Boxer, when totalitarian rule is re-established with the bloodstained postscript to the founding slogan: But Some Animals Are More Equal Than Others.<br>WAR IS PEACE.

Though a polemicist and satirist at heart, his anti-totalitarian ideals are expounded with deft story-telling and a simplicity that belies the ultimately complex debates to which he gave voice. The changing responses to his two classic novels, <em>Animal Farm</em> (1945) and <em>Nineteen Eighty-four</em> (1949), provide an illuminating account of the developing preoccupations of the second half of the 20th century.<br><br>In this Readers' Guide, Daniel Lea takes a decisive path through the maze of interpretations that has accumulated around Orwell's best-known novels, examining critical reactions from the beginning of the Cold War through to the collapse of Communist Eastern Europe, and at the same time placing Orwell within a long tradition of dystopian writings.

The `icon&#39; of the series, Marilyn Monroe, originated as early as 1962. From then on until the last year of his life, Warhol created a virtual museum of personalities, both living and deceased, from the worlds of film, showbusiness, art, literature and politics. Among the best-known images shown here are those of Truman Capote, David Hockney, John Lennon, Judy Garland, Rudolph Nureyev, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. Characteristic of Warhol&#39;s unique style of portraiture is the use of silkscreens made from polaroid photographs - some of which were taken by the artist during encounters with his `sitters&#39; at the notorious Factory. Warhol primed his silkscreens with a rich repertoire of colours, both bold and expressionistic, which gave rise to some of the most distinctive portraits of our time, reviving the genre more successfully than anyone since John Singer Sargent. This book includes more than 70 subjects, from Joseph Beuys to Elizabeth Taylor - an extraordinary gallery of some of the most famous and influential figures of the century, by one of its most important artists. Henry Geldzahler established the Department of 20th Century Art at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. From 1978 to 1983 he served as Commissioner of Cultural Affairs for the City of New York.</p><p></p><h2>Death Has Deep Roots: A Second World War Mystery (British Library Crime Classics)</h2><p><br><br>At the Central Criminal Court, an eager crowd awaits the trial of Victoria Lamartine, an active participant in the Resistance during the war. She is now employed at the Family Hotel in Soho, where Major Eric Thoseby has been found murdered. <br><br>The cause of death? A stabbing reminiscent of techniques developed by the Maquisards. While the crime is committed in England, its roots are buried in a vividly depicted wartime France. Thoseby is believed to have fathered Lamartine's child, and the prosecution insist that his death is revenge for his abandonment of Lamartine and her arrest by the Gestapo. <br><br>A last-minute change in Lamartine's defence counsel grants solicitor Nap Rumbold just eight days to prove her innocence, with the highest of stakes should he fail. <br><br>The proceedings of the courtroom are interspersed with Rumbold's perilous quest for evidence, which is aided by his old wartime comrades.</p><p></p><h2>Against the Idols of the Age</h2><p><p>Little known outside his native Australia, David Stove was one of the most illuminating and brilliant philo�sophical essayists of the postwar era. A fearless at�tacker of intellectual and cultural orthodoxies, Stove left powerful critiques of scientific irrationalism, Dar�winian theories of human behavior, and philosophi�cal idealism. He was also an occasional essayist of considerable charm and polemical snap. Stove's writ�ing is both rigorous and immensely readable. It is, in the words of Roger Kimball, "an invigorating blend of analytic lucidity, mordant humor, and an amount of common sense too great to be called 'common.'" <em>Against the Idols of the Age </em>brings together a repre�sentative selection of Stove's writing and is an ideal introduction to his work.</p> <p>The book opens with some of Stove's most impor�tant attacks on irrationalism in the philosophy of sci�ence. He exposes the roots of this fashionable attitude, tracing it through writers like Paul Feyerabend andThomas Kuhn to Karl Popper. Stove was a born controversialist, so it is not surpris�ing that when he turned his attention to contemporary affairs he said things that are politically incorrect. The topical essays that make up the second part of the book show Stove at his most withering and combative. Whether the subject is race, femi�nism, the Enlightenment, or the demand for "non-coercive philosophy," Stove is on the mark with a battery of impressive arguments expressed in sharp, uncompromis�ing prose. <em>Against the Idols of the Age </em>concludes with a generous sampling of his blistering attacks on Darwinism.</p> <p>David Stove's writings are an undiscovered treasure. Although readers may dis�agree with some of his opinions, they will find it difficult to dismiss his razor-sharp arguments. <em>Against the Idols of the Age </em>is the first book to make the full range of this important thinker available to the general reader.</p></p><p>David Stove is thoughtful, trenchant, sharp, and wonderfully disrespectful of the established pieties of our time. He's also a treat to read. --Harvey C. Mansfield, professor of government, Harvard University <p>A philosopher whose wit and satirical genius was directed against the follies and absurdities to be found in philosophers--and others. --David Armstrong, emeritus professor of philosophy, University of Sydney </p><p>In a culture of iconoclastic posturing, David Stove is the true iconoclast. He is outrageously wrong about some things, but putting up with that is a price worth paying for his formidable, and frequently funny, contributions to--in the words of the great Dr. Johnson--clearing the mind of cant. --Richard John Neuhaus, editor in chief, First Things </p><p>David Stove took no intellectual prisoners. A deadly serious (and hilariously funny) enemy of intellectual cant and the higher pretensions, he wrote to kill. In the process he demonstrated what had come to seem questionable: that professional philosophers can still make a vital contribution to public debate. Many thanks to Roger Kimball for making these brilliant essays available in America. --Owen Harries, editor, The National Interest </p><p>David Stove was a man before his time, providing answers to a number of mounting problems in politics and academic life whose eventual, disastrous dimensions were foreseen by very few others when he wrote. He long had a small circle of admirers who appreciated not only his intellectual brilliance and the polish of his unadorned prose, but how funny he invariably was. Since his death in 1994, the circle of insiders has widened to include many people who had not read him when he was alive but who, on discovering him, have asked almost incredulously: why didn't I know of his work before? This book shows just how much, until now, they have all missed. --Keith Windschuttle, author of The Killing of History </p><p>As Francis Bacon alerted us to the misleading habits of mind--idols of Tribe, Cave, Marketplace and Theater--that deprive us of knowledge, David Stove exposes the irrationalities of fashionable ideologies that deliver us over to relativism, skepticism and cynicism. Roger Kimball offers us, with an introductory overview, an astute collection of essays by Stove, brilliantly exposing current ideologies under the Baconian title Against the Idols of the Age. Stove's carefully reasoned arguments expose the intellectual fraudulence and cant that have blinded us to the attainability of knowledge. He makes the case not only that it is intellectually respectable to seek the truth, but that it is contemptible to be bullied by bad arguments and paradigms of the politically and intellectually "correct" into abandoning the search. Stove is an independent and honest philosopher who, like Voltaire and Nietzsche, has the wit to make us laugh as we learn. --John Silber, chancellor Boston University</p><p>Roger Kimball is co-editor and publisher of <em>The New Criterion</em>, president and publisher of Encounter Books, and an art critic for the <em>London Spectator </em>and <em>National Review</em>.</p><br><br><p>Roger Kimball is co-editor and publisher of <em>The New Criterion</em>, president and publisher of Encounter Books, and an art critic for the <em>London Spectator </em>and <em>National Review</em>.</p><br><br><p> <em>David Stove </em>(1927-1994) taught philosophy at the University of New South Wales and the University of Sydney.

The tomb contained their wonderfully preserved mummies, lying within magnificent coffins and surrounded by a gorgeous array of palace furniture and funerary equipment. This book containing the excavator&#x2019;s official reports on this important find was originally published in 1907-1908.</p><p>Theodore M. Davis (1837-1915) was a wealthy American financier and lawyer and one of the key figures in the history of archaeological exploration in the Valley of the Kings. He had the reputation of uncovering a new tomb every season, and his finds now fill a gallery in the Cairo Museum.</p><h2>Anne Truitt: Perception and Reflection</h2><p>Anne Truitt (1921-2004) is a heroine of American Minimalism, an increasingly admired artist whose journals (<i>Daybook</i>, <i>Prospect</i>, <i>Turn</i>) have a longstanding and devoted readership, but whose art has not previously been the subject of a substantial monograph. <i>Perception and Reflection</i> remedies this historical oversight superbly and decisively. The evolution of Truitt's sensibility is at once a classic Minimalist story and the tale of a truly independent spirit: following an encounter with the black paintings of Ad Reinhardt at the Guggenheim in 1961, she abandoned her earlier sculptural style and began to make stark, columnar works inscribed with bands of sometimes bright and sometimes quiet color. Truitt's account of this transition betrays her rare clarity and sensitivity: "I thought to myself, 'If I make a sculpture, it will just stand up straight and the seasons will go around it and the light will go around it and it will record time.'"</p><p>Kristen Hileman is associate curator, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, where she recently curated The Cinema Effect: Illusion, Reality and the Moving Image, Part II, Realisms (2008).

But few people are aware of the bagel&#x2019;s provenance, let alone its adventuresome history. This charming book tells the remarkable story of the bagel&#x2019;s journey from the tables of seventeenth-century Poland to the freezers of middle America today, a story of often surprising connections between a cheap market-day snack and centuries of Polish, Jewish, and American history.</p><p>Research in international archives and numerous personal interviews uncover the bagel&#x2019;s links with the defeat of the Turks by Polish King Jan Sobieski in 1683, the Yiddish cultural revival of the late nineteenth century, and Jewish migration across the Atlantic to America. There the story moves from the bakeries of New York&#x2019;s Lower East Side to the Bagel Bakers&#x2019; Local 388 Union of the 1960s, and the attentions of the mob. For all its modest size, the bagel has managed to bridge cultural gaps, rescue kings from obscurity, charge the emotions, and challenge received wisdom. Maria Balinska weaves together a rich, quirky, and evocative history of East European Jewry and the unassuming ring-shaped roll the world has taken to its heart.</p></p><p><p>Maria Balinska is editor of BBC Radio&#x2019;s World Current Affairs department, and a journalist and documentary maker specializing in Eastern Europe and the United States. She lives in London.</p>From the Italian ciambella in a 17th-century portrait of a young prince to the 1959 album <i>Bagels and Bongos</i> by pianist Irving Fields, journalist and BBC radio editor Balinska traces the cultural identity of a New York City icon from its humble beginnings in Poland to the freezer section of American supermarkets. Balinska's own interest in the bagel began with a year spent in Warsaw, Poland, as a graduate student, where she learned that her own family history was relevant to that of the bagel. She then unearths a plethora of little-known facts about this breakfast staple, recounting its role in children's nursery rhymes, Poland's economic crisis of 1929, even its place in a <i>McCall's</i> magazine spread in 1963 next to Shirley Temple where the magazine encouraged its readers to Join the stars below in this salute to Manhattan's most popular breakfast&#x2014;bagels and lox. While the book may be too dry for the run-of-the- mill bagel lover, academics and dedicated foodies will appreciate Balinska's considerable research as well as her forays into the late 19th-century Jewish immigrant experience and American pop culture.

But in the 1970s there occurred an episode of high inflation and high unemployment, which was inconsistent with orthodox theory. As a result, macroeconomists began to pay much greater attention to the microfoundations of their subject.</p><p>In this book Roger E. A. Farmer takes a somewhat controversial point of view, arguing for the future of macroeconomics as a branch of applied general equilibrium theory. His main theme is that macroeconomics is best viewed as the study of equilibrium environments in which the welfare theorems break down. This approach makes it possible to discuss the role of government policies in a context in which policy may serve some purpose.</p><p>Since the publication of the first edition in 1993, self-fulfilling prophecies has become a major competitor to the real business-cycle view of economic fluctuations. The second edition has been updated in three ways: (1) problems are included at the end of every chapter, and a study guide containing sample answers to all of the problems is available; (2) a new chapter discusses research from the past five years on business fluctuations in multisector models; and (3) the chapter on representative agent growth models now includes an appendix that explains the transversality condition.</p></p><p>Roger Farmer is Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania."

In the past 20 years, however, an increasing amount of evidence has accumulated to suggest that subcortical structures such as the thalamus and the basal ganglia may participate in specific aspects of mental activity. This is the first book to focus entirely on this issue. The collaboration of an international group of researchers, this volume clearly describes the clinical patterns of neuropsychological disorders found in patients with subcortical lesions, and accurately reports the results of animal research. New imaging techniques allow the disorders to be correlated with the size and site of the lesion. This comprehensive work discusses the pattern that emerges from these findings, which is essentially that cognitive functions are mediated by complex neural circuits involving both cortical and subcortical structures.<br></p><p>G.

Secondly, the topics have been re-arranged in such a way as to better prepare the novice which added considerably to the book's readability. Experts might want to look at quite restricted areas but beginners tend to think in broad terms and simple questions. By having the first portion look at broad concepts and the second to look at regional and local detail, the authors have been able to separate and clarify matters that other texts have, in the past, failed to do.

At root, his book can be seen as a superb exercise in problem-solving: one that actually established "magic" as a historical problem worthy of investigation. Thomas asked productive questions, not least challenging the prevailing assumption that folk belief was unworthy of serious scholarly attention, and his work usefully reframed the existing debate in much broader terms, allowing for more extensive exploration of correlations, not only between different sorts of popular belief, but also between popular belief and state religion. It was this that allowed Thomas to reach his famous conclusion that the advent of Protestantism &#x2013; which drove out much of the "superstition" that characterised the Catholicism of the period &#x2013; created a vacuum filled by other forms of belief; for example, Catholic priests had once blessed their crops, but Protestants refused to do so. That left farmers looking for other ways of ensuring a good harvest. It was this, Thomas argues, that explains the survival of what we now think of as "magic" at a time such beliefs might have been expected to decline &#x2013; at least until science arose to offer alternative paradigms.</p></p><p><p><strong>Dr Simon Young</strong> holds a doctorate in Medieval History and teaches at the University of Florence.

Providing information on and photos of medicinal plants and where to harvest them, anthropologist David E. Young and botanist Robert D. Rogers chronicle the life, beliefs, and healing practices of Medicine Man Russell Willier in his native Alberta, Canada. Despite being criticized for sharing his knowledge, Willier later found support in other healers as they began to realize the danger that much of their traditional practices could die out with them.&nbsp;<br><br>With Young and Rogers, Willier offers his practices here for future generations. At once a study and a guide,&nbsp;<i>A Cree Healer and His Medicine Bundle</i>&nbsp;touches on how indigenous healing practices can be used to complement mainstream medicine, improve the treatment of chronic diseases, and lower the cost of healthcare. The authors discuss how mining, agriculture, and forestry are threatening the continued existence of valuable wild medicinal plants and the role of alternative healers in a modern health care system. Sure to be of interest to ethnobotanists, medicine hunters, naturopaths, complementary and alternative health practitioners, ethnologists, anthropologists, and academics, this book will also find an audience with those interested in indigenous cultures and traditions.</p><p><b>DAVID EARL YOUNG</b>&nbsp;spent much of his childhood in Sierra Leone, West Africa.

He grew up in a large family of twelve brothers and sisters. His father was a skilled hunter and trapper who passed his knowledge about the traditional Woods Cree way of life on to his son. Willier attended Catholic mission school but quit in order to help his parents on the family farm. Even at an early age, Russell showed signs of having been selected by the Spirit World to be a healer, but he resisted for many years. Eventually, he accepted this responsibility and received the medicine bundle of his great grandfather, Moostoos, a well-known healer in the area and signer of Treaty 8. By the time Willier received his medicine bundle, the knowledge of how to use the little plant packets inside it had been lost, so Russell showed them to elders and asked if they knew how these &#x201c;combinations&#x201d; were used. Gradually, over many years, Russell pieced together the information he needed to begin practice as a Medicine Man. Willier, who still lives on the Sucker Creek Reserve, travels extensively to treat those who call upon him for help.<p>&nbsp;&#x201c;What a profound gift Russell Willier has given to the world, with the help and support of his friends, colleagues and researchers anthropologist David Young and ethnobotanist and herbalist Robert Dale Rogers! The depth of Mr. Willier&#x2019;s knowledge and experience about healing plants and their properties is matched only by his kindness and generosity in sharing this knowledge and the strength of the personal bonds lasting over decades that allowed the creation of this book. The book is unique in the partnerships that it reflects, in the compellingly personal way the knowledge is presented, and in the ties of each special featured healing plant to a particular place, habitat, and season: truly place-based knowledge and practice. Balancing the need to safeguard and respect this knowledge with the concerns that the teachings will be lost to younger generations if it is not recorded, this book reveals sacred knowledge yet also cautions us against its misuse. Key to the book is the understanding that medicinal treatments are deeply embedded in our emotional and psychological condition, and that human health and well-being are completely dependent on the health of other species and of the environment as a whole.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Nancy Turner, PhD, professor, University of Victoria, and renowned ethnobotanist and leading expert on First Nations use of medicinal plants of the Pacific Northwest</p><p>&#x201c;While the medicinal plants discussed here are generally well known, what is most interesting is the various discussions of why certain plants are useful for certain medical problems.

Lately, however, ancient historians and Classical archaeologists have undertaken a major reappraisal of their subject, one result of which has been a broadening view of the Archaic period and its importance to the history of Greece. In this first major book on Archaic Greece to be written by an archaeologist, Professor Snodgrass shows how the supremacy of Classical Greece would have been impossible without the preceding centuries of the Archaic period.&nbsp;The intellectual revolution which divided the Archaic period from the Oassical transformed something remarkable into something unique. But there was an earlier revolution, a "structural revolution," which took place not merely within the Archaic period, but at its beginning. It had far-reaching effects: it established the economic basis of Greek society, as well as the main outlines of its social framework; it drew the political map of the Greek world in a form that was to endure for four centuries; it set up, with even greater permanence, the forms of state that were to determine Greek political history; it provided the interests and goals, not merely for Greek but for Western art as a whole, which were to be pursued over the next two and a half millennia; it gave Greece in the Homeric epics an ideal of behavior and a memento of past glory to sustain it; it provided much of the basis of Greek religion; and it furnished many lesser things, among them the means for Greek society to defend its independence militarily. It is doubtful whether, before or since, all these features have ever come about in one conn try with such concertedness and such speed.&nbsp;Archaic Greece gives a broader cultural history of the period than has hitherto been attempted, and Professor Snodgrass shows that it can be seen, for perhaps the first time, as a complete episode in its own right. His fresh and personal approach to his subject, together with the book's superb illustrations, will ensure a wide audience.</p><p><b>Anthony M.

These vivid stories also raise larger pastoral questions of discernment, hospitality, inclusion, and belonging.</p><p>"I was brought up as an Episcopalian, but I never doubted that I belonged to the Catholic Church," says Webber in this paean to the Episcopal Church as reflected in the stories of 11 converts from Roman Catholicism. A homogeneous group, all are from the educated middle class; five, like the author, are now Episcopal priests. Taken together, their stories portray an Episcopal Church very much like the church they left, but, in their opinion, more responsive, less authoritarian and far superior in art and liturgy. Despite his preference for Anglicanism, Webber is careful not to badmouth Rome; in his mind, the two denominations belong to one big happy family and, indeed, he seems more comfortable with his Catholic cousins than with his barely mentioned evangelical Episcopal siblings. Of undoubted interest to Episcopal "inquirer" groups, this book should also be taken seriously by Catholic decision-makers who wonder why denominational loyalties are fraying. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.In Finding Home, Christopher Webber tells the stories of men and women who left the church of their childhood for a number of different reasons: questions of conscience, remarriage after divorce, conflict over authority, the need to explore and to ask questions of their faith, instruction for their children, a hunger for spiritual growth. Finding Home presents what it meant for a lawyer, a pilot, a nurrse, an executive, a homemaker, two priests, and a bishop to leave the Roman Catholic Church and enter the Anglican Communion. The stories of their journeys into the Episcopal Church also raise larger issues of conversion, discernment, hospitality, including, church membrhsip, theology, and belonging. Finding Home provides the reader with a great deal of "food for thought" and a framework to consider themselves and their own situations with respect to membership in their church. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>The Tragedie of Macbeth (Applause Books)</h2><p>If there ever has been a groundbreaking edition that likewise returns the reader to the original Shakespeare text, it will be the Applause Folio Texts.

Moving beyond the listing of mere facts, it stresses the causal chains of events that constitute the mechanisms of body function. The fundamental purpose of this textbook is to present the principles and facts of human physiology in a format that is suitable for undergraduates regardless of academic background or field of study. Vander&#39;s human physiology, thirteenth edition, carries on the tradition of clarity and accuracy, while refining and updating the content to meet the needs of today&#39;s instructors and students. The thirteenth edition features a streamlined, clinically oriented focus to the study of human body systems. It has also responded to reviewer requests for more clinical applications. Physiology inquiries are maintained throughout the chapters. These critical-thinking questions associated with figures are just one more opportunity to add to the student&#39;s learning experience.</p><p>Eric P.

From suffering comes wisdom, and these poems find meaning in the loss of fortune and reputation, exile, and alienation. "Woe is wondrously clinging; clouds glide," reads a stoic, matter-of-fact observation in <i>Maxims II</i> on nature's indifference to human suffering. Another form of wisdom emerges in the form of folk remedies, such as charms to treat stabbing pain, cysts, childbirth, and nightmares of witch-riding caused by a dwarf.

Campbell Award and nominations for the Hugo and Nebula. <br>Jason Taverner world-famous talk show host and man-about-town wakes up one day to find that no one knows who he is including the vast databases of the totalitarian government. And in a society where lack of identification is a crime, Taverner has no choice but to go on the run with a host of shady characters, including crooked cops and dealers of alien drugs. But do they know more than they are letting on? And just how can a person s identity be erased overnight?<br><p></p>PHILIP K.

Tauber shows why Thoreau still seems so relevant today&#x2014;more relevant in many respects than he seemed to his contemporaries. Although Thoreau has been skillfully and thoroughly examined as a writer, naturalist, mystic, historian, social thinker, Transcendentalist, and lifelong student, we may find in Tauber's portrait of Thoreau the moralist a characterization that binds all these aspects of his career together.<br><br>Thoreau was caught at a critical turn in the history of science, between the ebb of Romanticism and the rising tide of positivism. He responded to the challenges posed by the new ideal of objectivity not by rejecting the scientific worldview, but by humanizing it for himself. Tauber portrays Thoreau as a man whose moral vision guided his life's work. Each of Thoreau's projects reflected a self-proclaimed "metaphysical ethics," an articulated program of self-discovery and self-knowing. By writing, by combining precision with poetry in his naturalist pursuits and simplicity with mystical fervor in his daily activity, Thoreau sought to live a life of virtue&#x2014;one he would characterize as marked by deliberate choice. This unique vision of human agency and responsibility will still seem fresh and contemporary to readers at the start of the twenty-first century.</p><p>"Tauber's book is encyclopedic&#x2014;not only a revealing and comprehensive study of Thoreau but also a full vision of the Romantic Weltanschauung and its relevance to contemporary concerns in philosophy, science, and poetics. While this scope is wildly ambitious, Tauber admirably delivers, always informing his parts with the whole, consistently altering the whole with his parts."&#x2014;Eric Wilson, author of <i>Emerson's Sublime Science</i><br><br>"In arguing for the centrally moral and ethical value of Thoreau's works, Tauber is taking a brave stance in these slippery postmodern times.... It's one thing to praise Thoreau for his opposition to the Mexican War, his philosophy of passive resistance, and his fervent opposition to slavery. It's quite another to argue that his entire project&#x2014;his whole sense of identity, self-formation, and his relation to nature&#x2014;is part of a deeply moral enterprise....Thoreau's modernity has been defined in many ways in recent years. Tauber adds another important and distinctive dimension to this discussion."&#x2014;H. Daniel Peck, John Guy Vassar Professor of English, Vassar College&#34;Tauber&#39;s book is encyclopedic-not only a revealing and comprehensive study of Thoreau but also a full vision of the Romantic Weltanschauung and its relevance to contemporary concerns in philosophy, science, and poetics.

But Thomas Doherty argues that, through the influence of television, America actually became a more open and tolerant place. Although many books have been written about this period, <i>Cold War, Cool Medium</i> is the only one to examine it through the lens of television programming. <br><br>To the unjaded viewership of Cold War America, the television set was not a harbinger of intellectual degradation and moral decay, but a thrilling new household appliance capable of bringing the wonders of the world directly into the home. The "cool medium" permeated the lives of every American, quickly becoming one of the most powerful cultural forces of the twentieth century. While television has frequently been blamed for spurring the rise of Senator Joseph McCarthy, it was also the national stage upon which America witnessed&#x2015;and ultimately welcomed&#x2015;his downfall. In this provocative and nuanced cultural history, Doherty chronicles some of the most fascinating and ideologically charged episodes in television history: the warm-hearted Jewish sitcom <i>The Goldbergs</i>; the subversive threat from <i>I Love Lucy</i>; the sermons of Fulton J. Sheen on <i>Life Is Worth Living</i>; the anticommunist series <i>I Led 3 Lives</i>; the legendary jousts between Edward R. Murrow and Joseph McCarthy on <i>See It Now</i>; and the hypnotic, 188-hour political spectacle that was the Army-McCarthy hearings. <br><br>By rerunning the programs, freezing the frames, and reading between the lines, <i>Cold War, Cool Medium</i> paints a picture of Cold War America that belies many black-and-white clich�s. Doherty not only details how the blacklist operated within the television industry but also how the shows themselves struggled to defy it, arguing that television was preprogrammed to reinforce the very freedoms that McCarthyism attempted to curtail.</p><p>Though conventional wisdom claims that television is a co-conspirator in the repressions of Cold War America, Doherty argues that during the Cold War, through television, America actually became a more tolerant place. He examines television programming and contemporary commentary of the late 1940s to the mid-1950s&#x2015;everything from <i>See It Now</i> to <i>I Love Lucy</i>, from Red Channels to the writings of Walter Winchell and Hedda Hopper. By rerunning the programs, freezing the frames, and reading between the lines, Doherty paints a picture of Cold War America that belies many black and white cliches.Thomas Doherty is a professor in the American studies department and chair of the film studies program at Brandeis University.

Hanssen</h2><p>From the bestselling author of American Tragedy and Perfect Murder, Perfect Town comes an even more stunning portrayal of America&#39;s dark side. Into the Mirror is the shocking story of FBI Special Agent Robert P. Hanssen, the master spy who singlehandedly created the greatest breach of security in the history of our country. Written in compelling, novelistic prose, Schiller re-creates a gripping portrait of Hanssen, who for twenty-two years was a loving husband, a devoted father of six, a deeply devout Catholic and member of Opus Dei, a passionate anticommunist, a dedicated FBI agent -- and a traitor the likes of which the United States has never before seen. On February 18, 2001, the FBI finally arrested Hanssen and charged him with selling to the Russians -- over a period of more than twenty years -- top-secret, classified information. Nothing that has been reported to date about this ordinary-looking but tormented man has revealed the astonishing facts that Lawrence Schiller and Norman Mailer -- collaborators on the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Executioner&#39;s Song and Oswald&#39;s Tale -- uncovered during their nine-month investigation into the life of this complex man. In seeking to solve this almost impenetrable mystery, Schiller and Mailer spent hundreds of hours interviewing members of Hanssen&#39;s family as well as his closest friends, colleagues, and fellow church members. They traveled to Moscow to interview a key member of the KGB who had handled the spy they knew only as &#34;Ramon Garcia.&#34; Into the Mirror gets inside the mind of a devious and dangerously brilliant man and creates an unforgettable portrait of someone so caught up in the struggle with his own personal demons that he would betray everything he holds sacred-his wife, his family, his religion, and his country.</p><p>Lawrence Schiller ranks among our greatest investigative journalists. In addition to his bestselling books, he has written for the <i>New Yorker</i> and other major publications. For many years he has appeared as an on-air consultant for the ABC and NBC networks. He lives in Los Angeles.</p><h2>Alexander the Great and His Empire: A Short Introduction</h2><p><p>This is the first publication in English of Pierre Briant's classic short history of Alexander the Great's conquest of the Persian empire, from the Mediterranean to Central Asia. Eschewing a conventional biographical focus, this is the only book in any language that sets the rise of Alexander's short-lived empire within the broad context of ancient Near Eastern history under Achaemenid Persian rule, as well as against Alexander's Macedonian background. As a renowned historian of both the Macedonians and the Persians, Briant is uniquely able to assess Alexander's significance from the viewpoint of both the conquerors and the conquered, and to trace what changed and what stayed the same as Alexander and the Hellenistic world gained ascendancy over Darius's Persia.</p><br><p> After a short account of Alexander's life before his landing in Asia Minor, the book gives a brief overview of the major stages of his conquest. This background sets the stage for a series of concise thematic chapters that explore the origins and objectives of the conquest; the nature and significance of the resistance it met; the administration, defense, and exploitation of the conquered lands; the varying nature of Alexander's relations with the Macedonians, Greeks, and Persians; and the problems of succession following Alexander's death.</p><br><p> For this translation, Briant has written a new foreword and conclusion, updated the main text and the thematic annotated bibliography, and added a substantial appendix in which he assesses the current state of scholarship on Alexander and suggests some directions for future research. More than ever, this masterful work provides an original and important perspective on Alexander and his empire.</p></p><p><p>"In this long-awaited translation, Pierre Briant's study of Alexander the Great finally reaches English readers. Briant's account reveals exciting new connections to this old story of Greek triumph, illuminating the vibrant Persian Empire as never before and giving us a picture of Alexander that is different from the often distorted accounts that have prevailed since the Enlightenment. This is a book not to be missed."<b>--Lawrence Tritle, Loyola Marymount University</b></p><p>"Pierre Briant is a scholar of the highest international standing. His book is set apart from the plethora of biographies of Alexander the Great by its focus on his origins and aims, the way he administered and organized his empire, and especially his impact on the areas he conquered, the last of which almost no other books address."<b>--Ian Worthington, author of <i>Alexander the Great: Man and God and Philip II of Macedonia</i></b></p><b>Pierre Briant</b> is the Professor of the History and Civilization of the Achaemenid World and the Empire of Alexander the Great at the Coll�ge de France. His many books include <i>From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire.</i></p><h2>Multivariate Statistics for Wildlife and Ecology Research</h2><p>With its focus on the practical application of the techniques of multivariate statistics, this book shapes the powerful tools of statistics for the specific needs of ecologists and makes statistics more applicable to their course of study. It gives readers a solid conceptual understanding of the role of multivariate statistics in ecological applications and the relationships among various techniques, while avoiding detailed mathematics and the underlying theory. More importantly, the reader will gain insight into the type of research questions best handled by each technique and the important considerations in applying them. Whether used as a textbook for specialised courses or as a supplement to general statistics texts, the book emphasises those techniques that students of ecology and natural resources most need to understand and employ in their research. While targeted for upper-division and graduate students in wildlife biology, forestry, and ecology, and for professional wildlife scientists and natural resource managers, this book will also be valuable to researchers in any of the biological sciences.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h2>Propaganda and Empire: The manipulation of British public opinion, 1880&#x2013;1960 (Studies in Imperialism, 1)</h2><p>It has been said that the British Empire, on which the sun never set, meant little to the man in the street. Apart from the jingoist eruptions at the death of Gordon or the relief of Mafeking he remained stonily indifferent to the imperial destiny that beckoned his rulers so alluringly. Strange, then that for three-quarters of a century it was scarcely possible to buy a bar of soap or a tin of biscuits without being reminded of the idea of Empire. Packaging, postcards, music hall, cinema, boy's stories and school books, exhibitions and parades, all conveyed the message that Empire was an adventure and an ennobling responsibility. Army and navy were a sure shield for the mother country and the subject peoples alike. Boys' brigades and Scouts stiffened the backbone of youth who flocked to join. <br><br>In this illuminating study John M. Mackenzie explores the manifestations of the imperial idea, from the trappings of royalty through writers like G. A. Henty to the humble cigarette card. He shows that it was so powerful and pervasive that it outlived the passing of Empire itself and, as events such as the Falklands 'adventure' showed, the embers continue to smoulder.</p><p><br>John MacKenzie is Emeritus Professor of Imperial History, Lancaster University and holds Honorary Professorships at Aberdeen, St Andrews and Stirling, as well as an Honorary Fellowship at Edinburgh.<br></p><h2>No Free Lunch: Why Specified Complexity Cannot Be Purchased without Intelligence</h2><p>Darwin's greatest accomplishment was to show how life might be explained as the result of natural selection. But does Darwin's theory mean that life was unintended? William A. Dembski argues that it does not. In this book Dembski extends his theory of intelligent design. Building on his earlier work in <i>The Design Inference</i> (Cambridge, 1998), he defends that life must be the product of intelligent design. Critics of Dembski's work have argued that evolutionary algorithms show that life can be explained apart from intelligence. But by employing powerful recent results from the <i>No Free Lunch Theory</i>, Dembski addresses and decisively refutes such claims. As the leading proponent of intelligent design, Dembski reveals a designer capable of originating the complexity and specificity found throughout the cosmos. Scientists and theologians alike will find this book of interest as it brings the question of creation firmly into the realm of scientific debate.</p><p><b>William A. Dembski</b> is associate research professor in the conceptual foundations of science at Baylor University and senior fellow with Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture in Seattle.In <i>No Free Lunch,</i> William Dembski gives the most profound challenge to the Modern Synthetic Theory of Evolution since this theory was first formulated in the 1930s. I differ from Dembski on some points, mainly in ways which strengthen his conclusion. (Frank J. Tipler, professor of mathematical physics, Tulane University; coauthor of The Anthropic Cosmological Principle; and author of The Physic)<br><br>In this book, William Dembski takes his statistical work on inferring design and translates it into an information-theoretic apparatus relevant to understanding biological fitness. In doing so, he has brought his argument for intelligent design into a domain that overlaps current work in evolutionary biology. As I see it, this is a landmark for intelligent design theory because, for the first time, it makes it possible to objectively evaluate the claims of evolutionary biology and intelligent design on common ground. (Martin Poenie, associate professor of biology, University of Texas at Austin)<br><br>Dembski lays the foundations for a research project aimed at answering one of the most fundamental scientific questions of our time: What is the maximal specified complexity that can be reasonably expected to emerge (in a given time frame) with and without various design assumptions? (Moshe Koppel, professor of mathematics, Bar-llan University, Israel)<br><br>This sequel to <i>The Design Inference</i> further enhances the credibility of Intelligent Design as a sound research program. Through solid historical and philosophical arguments, Dembski succeeds in showing how specified complexity reliably detects design. His critique of Darwinian and other naturalistic accounts of evolution is built on a set of powerful and lucid arguments; his formulation of an alternative to these accounts is simply compelling. (Muzaffar Iqbal, author of Islam and Science and founder-president of the Center for Islam and Science (CIS))<br><br>The valid philosophical arguments and historical examples make the study really agreeable to a large audience. (<i>Auss</i>)<br><br>I disagree strongly with the position taken by William Dembski. But I do think that he argues strongly and that those of us who do not accept his conclusions should read his book and form our own opinions and counterarguments. He should not be ignored. (Michael Ruse, Florida State University)<br><br><i>No Free Lunch</i> is written for scholars and is filled with equations and careful technical definitions. Much of the text, however, is accessible for a broad audience and the book should prove useful to anyone wishing to explore the degree to which intelligent design can be formulated in a mathematically rigorous way.

Solid wax is somehow changed into light and heat. But how? Travel back in time to December 28, 1848 in London, England to one of the most famous juvenile science Christmas lectures at the Royal Institution. British scientist Michael Faraday encouraged kids to carefully observe a candle and to try to figure out how it burned. Since Faraday&#x2019;s lecture, &#x201c;The Chemical History of a Candle,&#x201d; was published in 1861, it&#x2019;s never been out of print. Faraday originally gave seven lectures on how a candle burns. Pattison has adapted the first 6000-word lecture to about 650 words for modern elementary students. Known as one of the best science experimenters ever, Faraday&#x2019;s passion was always to answer the basic questions of science: &#x201c;What is the cause? Why does it occur?&#x201d;</p><p><b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:&nbsp;</b><b>Darcy Pattison</b> is the author of <i>Abayomi, the Brazilian Puma: The True Story of an Orphaned Cub</i>, which was named a 2015 National Science Teacher's Association Outstanding Science Trade Book. <i>Desert Baths</i> was named a 2013 NSTA Outstanding Science Trade Book. For more, see darcypattison.com/book.&nbsp;<br> <b>ABOUT THE ILLUSTRATOR:&nbsp;</b><b>Peter Willis</b> With over 20 years' experience in illustration and design, illustrator Peter Willis continues to be as enthusiastic and passionate about his work as ever. His illustrations have palpable character, bringing them to life through his craft and quirky approach. He lives in North East England with his wife and daughter. This is his debut picture book. Peter Willis brings humor to the story, but he also manages to convey accurate information about matter and its physical properties.Gr 1&#x2013;4&#x2014;Adapted from scientist Michael Faraday's own "Chemical History of a Candle," this is the story of one of the Royal Institution's Christmas lectures for children, specifically, Faraday's 1848 talk and demonstration on candles. The lecture series began in 1825 and has continued to present day, with a pause during World War II. The story starts with descriptions of the excitement of the crowd, the sights and sounds of the London streets, and the lecture hall, structured for the crowd's ease of observation and safety. Faraday guides the crowd, describing what is happening and the thought process a scientist uses when making observations. A diagram aids in the discussion of what happens when a candle burns. The main takeaway is that readers should always ask and answer the questions "What is the cause? Why does it occur?" when making observations. The book is whimsically illustrated in various media and incorporates printed text into the artwork. However, the text, which includes challenging vocabulary, British spellings, and, occasionally, odd sentence structures left over from the adaptation of the original lecture, makes the intended audience unclear. VERDICT Despite a few missteps, this is a potential selection for readers who will have the opportunity to perform experiments afterward or those beginning to learn the process of scientific inquiry. Also, a good option for fans of Jacqueline Briggs Martin's Snowflake Bentley (HMH, 1998).&#x2014;Paige Mellinger, Gwinnett County Public Libraries, Lillburn, GA</p><h2>Practice Guidelines for Family Nurse Practitioners</h2><p><p>Prepare for FNP practice with the latest evidence-based guidelines! <b>Practice Guidelines for Family Nurse Practitioners, 4th Edition </b>provides essential information on current assessment and management protocols for primary care patients of all ages.

This book provides a perceptive account of his work to date, locating it within both Finnish modernism and that of Dutch De Stijl.<br> Leivisk�'s profound interest in architectural history has not led him to mere imitation of historic forms: even in his faithful adherence to the principles of De Stijl he succeeds in dissolving its formal vocabulary of abstraction by his uncanny and totally unnerving use of daylight. What is reflected in Professor Quantrill's authoritative account is not only Leivisk�'s sensitivity to the chemistry of built form when immersed in light, but the interaction of physical form and musical structure in his designs.<br> Born in Helsinki in 1936, Leivisk� studied architecture at Helsinki's celebrated University of Technology in Otaniemi. After graduating in 1959, he began lecturing there on the history of architecture, and continued to do so until 1971. His architectural practice dates from 1964, when he was only 28, and his best known and most admired work - both executed buildings and projects - has centred on the design of religious buildings for the Lutheran Church. The qualities of his architecture, as well as his own uniquely personal talents as a designer, have been widely recognised since the completion of St Thomas's Parish Church and Centre in Oulu (1975).<br> Leivisk� was made a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts in 1991, and was appointed as an 'Artist Professor' by the Finnish President in 1992. In 1994 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. He was awarded the prestigious Carlsberg Prize in 1995, and in 1997 he followed Alvar Aalto and Reima Pietil� in becoming the architecture Member of the Academy of Finland.</p><p>MALCOLM QUANTRILL studied architecture at the universities of Liverpool and Pennsylvania, and received his doctorate in urbanism from the Technical University of Wroclaw. He is a former Director of the Architectural Association, London, and Dean of the School of Environmental Design in the University of North London. Since 1986 he has been the Distinguished Professor of Architecture at Texas A&amp;M University. He began studying modern Finnish architecture in 1959 and Juha Leivisk� and the continuity of Finnish modern architecture is his sixth book on this subject.</p><h2>Casenotes Legal Briefs: Criminal Law Keyed to Kaplan, Weisberg, &amp; Binder, Seventh Edition (Casenote Legal Briefs)</h2><p>After your casebook, <b>Casenote Legal Briefs</b> will be your most important reference source for the entire semester.

Even before the era of printing, patterns of stars have been recognized by humans and their histories have been passed on from generation to generation, culture to culture. This book is the ultimate constellation reference book. Finally, a book exists that brings together a variety of information about constellations, including: the size, visibility, and relative brightness of all eighty-eight constellations; former locations of extinct constellations; the number of visible stars in each constellation; and more. Using tables, this information is presented in the first part of the book so that constellations can be readily compared and a general view of them developed. In the second part of the book, each constellation is taken in turn, with a star chart and map illustrating the associated celestial figure, supported by a comprehensive list of essential properties. This highly illustrated volume provides the most complete reference to date covering all aspects of the constellations and will be helpful for astronomers, both amateur and professional, educators and science writers.</p><p>Covering eighty-eight constellations, this highly illustrated volume provides the most complete astronomical reference work to date.

The volume equally reflects the broad range of activity Aristotelian studies comprise today: such activity ranges from the primarily textual and philological to the application of broadly Aristotelian themes to contemporary problems irrespective of their narrow textual fidelity. In between these extremes one finds the core of Aristotelian scholarship as it is practiced today, and as it is primarily represented in this <em>Handbook</em>: textual exegesis and criticism. Even within this more limited core activity, one witnesses a rich range of pursuits, with some scholars seeking primarily to understand Aristotle in his own philosophical milieu and others seeking rather to place him into direct conversation with contemporary philosophers and their present-day concerns. No one of these enterprises exhausts the field. On the contrary, one of the most welcome and enlivening features of the contemporary Aristotelian scene is precisely the cross-fertilization these mutually beneficial and complementary activities offer one another. <br> <br>The volume, prefaced with an introduction to Aristotle's life and works by the editor, covers the main areas of Aristotelian philosophy and intellectual enquiry: ethics, metaphysics, politics, logic, language, psychology, rhetoric, poetics, theology, physical and biological investigation, and philosophical method. It also, and distinctively, looks both backwards and forwards: two chapters recount Aristotle's treatment of earlier philosophers, who proved formative to his own orientations and methods, and another three chapters chart the long afterlife of Aristotle's philosophy, in Late Antiquity, in the Islamic World, and in the Latin West.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christopher Shields</strong> is George N.

Johnson describes with accurate detail Ireland&#39;s barbarous beginnings, Oliver Cromwell&#39;s religious &#34;crusade,&#34; the tragic Irish potato famine, the Ulster resistance and the outstanding fact of the constant British-Irish connection and the fearful toll of life it exacted. Among the anonymous multitude are famous names such as &#34;Silken Thom&#34; Kildare, Thomas Wentworth, Archbishop Plunkett and Lord Frederick Cavendish. And yet many great men marshaled their energies and wits to settle Ireland: Sir Henry Sidney, Sire Walter Raleigh, Edmund Spenser, Churchill and others.</p><p><b>Paul Johnson</b>, a well-known writer and journalist, was the editor of the <i>New Statesman</i> from 1965 to 1970 and is the author of several books, including<i> A History of Christianity</i>, <i>A History of the Modern World from 1917 to the 1980s</i>, and <i>A History of the Jews</i>."[Paul Johnson] is wonderfully adroit at condensing history in an interesting way." &#x2014; <i>Kliatt</i></p><h2>Parasitism: The Diversity and Ecology of Animal Parasites</h2><p>Nearly all living organisms are exploited by some sort of parasite. But what are parasites? How many different types are there? What exactly is parasitism? In this undergraduate textbook parasitism is described as an ecological relationship. Ecology implies the study of the interaction between organisms and their environments and the fact that parasites&#39; hosts are alive makes this concept even more exciting, combining traditionally disparate disciplines such as immunology and physiology with ecology and epidemiology! All the major groups of animal parasites are described, who they are, how they live, their biogeography, evolution, the influence they exert on their hosts&#39; populations, their immunological, pathological, and biochemical implications. Written in an accessible style, the subject matter is brought to life with numerous illustrations and textboxes containing anecdotal, interesting, and supplementary material. Essential for all undergraduate students studying parasitology, Parasitism: The Diversity and Ecology of Animal Parasites will also be useful reading for graduates and researchers in zoology and ecology.</p><p>Parasitism: The Diversity and Ecology of Animal Parasites is the first comprehensive parasitology textbook to explain parasitism from an ecological standpoint. The relationship of the parasite to its environment is stressed. The fact that this environment is often alive makes this viewpoint even more fascinating. All of the major groups of animal parasites are examined, but also their biogeography, communities, evolution, and the way they influence the populations of their hosts. The immunological, pathological and biochemical implications of parasites are also discussed.Gerald W. Esch is Charles M.

New media features and page layout modules in CSS3 let you make pages which respond to the capabilities of the device that's viewing them, automatically optimizing your content for multiple screen sizes and giving your visitors a tailored experience.</li> <br> <table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <li><strong>Eye candy!</strong><br> CSS3 brings web documents to life without complicated JavaScript. Rotate, scale and skew page elements in both two and three dimensions, add smooth transitional animations to elements when their values change, and go even further with keyframe animations which give you fine control over the behavior of your page elements.</li> <br> <li><strong>A better reading experience</strong><br> The web was made for reading text, but for years we've had to use a handful of fonts in a very conservative way. CSS3 brings the power to use any font you wish, to decorate the text with drop shadows and outlining, plus new ways of laying out the text such as in multiple columns, like a newspaper or magazine.</li> <br> <li><strong>Easier to maintain</strong><br> Using CSS2.1 usually means adding images (and extra markup) to your documents in order to achieve what should be simple effects. Something as basic as adding rounded corners to an element can mean using up to four extra empty elements to accommodate the graphics required to fake the appearance. CSS3 was created to address just these problems, so you can add rounded corners, drop shadows, gradient backgrounds and much more without writing unnecessary markup or creating multiple image files -- meaning a lot less work to make and maintain your documents.</li> <br> <li><strong>Cleaner code</strong><br> The greatly expanded range of selectors in CSS3 means you can add special formatting to links depending on their destination, loop through long tables and lists, even select form elements depending on their current state -- all without having to clutter your code with surplus class attributes.</li> </ol></p><p><p>Peter Gasston has been a web developer for over 10 years in both agency and corporate settings.

But different theologians give different account of faith--some say it is simply a belief that God exists, other say it is trust in God. In this third and final volume of his trilogy on philosophical theology, Swinburne analyzes the purposes for practicing a religion--the attainment of salvation for oneself and the rendering of due worship and obedience to God--and concludes that both trust and belief are necessary for religious faith, but that the belief involved is a fairly weak kind--the belief that a certain creed is more likely than others to be true.</p><p>Richard Swinburne is Emeritus Nolloth Professor of the Philosophy of the Christian Religion at the University of Oxford, and a Fellow of the British Academy.<br>"Swinburne's discussion offers the most sustained, and perhaps the most interesting, treatment of these and related questions from a philosophical perspective in many years....Admirably illustrates the usefulness of an analytic approach to problems in the philosophy of religion."--<em>Religious Studies</em> <em>Review</em><p></p><br>"Swinburne's lucidity, philosophical breadth and sophistication, excellence in argumentation, and boldness in conviction will set the standard in philosophy of religion for a long time to come."--<em>The Philosophical Review</em><p></p><br>"[Though] part of a larger series, [The book] can be read and appreciated on its own merit....[Swinburne] communicates well, and the interested philosophy of religion student will not only gain information here, but...can see a model of an appropriate philosophical method for our day.

Within days, a British Royal Navy Task Force is assembled and dispatched. This is the story of D Squadron, 22 SAS, commanded by Cedric Delves. <br> <br>The relentless tempo of events defies belief. Raging seas, inhospitable glaciers, hurricane-force winds, helicopter crashes, raids behind enemy lines--the Squadron prevailed against them all, but the cost was high. Eight died and more were wounded or captured. Holding fast to their humanity, D Squadron's fighters were there at the start and end of the Falklands War, the first to raise a Union Jack over Government House in Stanley. <br> <br>Across an Angry Sea is a chronicle of daring, skill and steadfastness among a tight-knit band of brothers; of going awry, learning fast, fighting hard, and winning through.<br></p><p><br>General Cedric Delves joined the Army in 1966, was commissioned into the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment and later joined the SAS, which he commanded at every level. He also led the UK's Special Forces before going on to become Commander of the Field Army.

He and his boys played a key part in the victory, brave and professional." -- Admiral the Rt Hon Lord West of Spithead GCB DSC PC<p></p><br><br>"Whether military professional or interested civilian, <em>Across An Angry Sea</em> really is a must-read book. It's much more than a reassuring account of those at the cutting edge of the British Army. Compellingly told and easily absorbed, this fast-moving story is a raw, humbling overdue history that explores the guts of combat with humility and candor. I have been waiting for this book to be written. Cedric Delves has met all my expectations and much more besides." -- General The Lord Richards GCB CBE DSO<p></p><br>"An exciting and honest account of a SAS command in war: of the leaders and the led; of offensive spirit and individual initiative; of doubt and uncertainty; of ingenuity and adaptability; and of sacrifice, courage and humanity. Those who seek to command in battle should study this account with care for it shows that, . . . 'continuing unto the end until it be thoroughly finished yields the true glory.'" -- General Sir Rupert Smith KCB DSO OBE QGM<p></p><br>"A relatively rare account of a contemporary special forces campaign written by its commander . . . Delves writes with warmth and humanity displaying no malice and a great deal of sympathy towards his Argentine opponents . . . highly recommended."--<em>Grounded Curiosity </em> <br><p></p><br>"Since the Second World War memoirs of great writers such as Eric Newby there have been few books like this one by a British officer attached to the Special Forces. Cedric Delves's account evokes the fear and excitement of going into battle and the emotions that went with sending other men to face danger. It captures the complexities and cock-ups of trying to coordinate teams from different units and different services in the most difficult of circumstances. Anyone who wants to understand the Falklands War, and perhaps war in general, should read this book." -- Richard Vinen, author of <em>National Service: A Generation in Uniform 1945-1963</em><p></p><br>"This book finally gives an account of SAS operations in the Falklands as I remember them. Its detailed narrative and personal insights impressively capture the raw courage, fighting spirit and agile improvisation that characterized the extraordinary men with whom we fought and happily shared our lives in 1982." -- Rear Admiral Chris Parry CBE<p></p><br></p><h2>History and Obstinacy (Zone Books)</h2><p><p><b>An epochal archaeology of the labor power that has been cultivated in the human body over the last two thousand years.</b></p><p>If Marx's opus <i>Capital </i>provided the foundational account of the forces of production in all of their objective, machine formats, what happens when the concepts of political economy are applied not to dead labor, but to its living counterpart, the human subject?

Now considered to be one of the greatest inventions for humanity since the printing press, anesthesia offered pain-free operations, childbirth with reduced suffering, and instant access to the world beyond consciousness. And yet, upon its introduction, Victorian medics, moralists, clergymen, and scientists, were plunged into turmoil.<br> In <em>Blessed Days of Anesthesia</em>, Stephanie Snow offers a vivid and engaging account of the early days of anesthesia. She unravels some key moments in medical history: from Humphry Davy's early experiments with nitrous oxide and the dramas that drove the discovery of ether anesthesia in America, to the outrage provoked by Queen Victoria's use of chloroform during the birth of Prince Leopold. And there are grisly stories too: frequent deaths, and even notorious murders. Interweaved throughout the story, a fascinating social change is revealed. For anesthesia caused the Victorians to rethink concepts of pain, sexuality, and the links between mind and body. From this turmoil, a profound change in attitudes began to be realized, as the view that physical suffering could, and should, be prevented permeated society, most tellingly at first in prisons and schools where pain was used as a method of social control. In this way, the discovery of anesthesia left not only a medical and scientific legacy that changed the world, but a compassionate one too.<br> Bringing together the history of science and an account of profound social change, <em>Blessed Days of Anesthesia</em> is a compelling, and broadly illuminating, account of a fascinating period in medical history.</p><p><br><strong>Stephanie J. Snow</strong> is a Research Associate at the Center for the History of Science, Technology &amp; Medicine at the University of Manchester.

For one thing, it was a strong element in his appeal to Elizabethans, who were much less woolly-mouthed and smooth-tongued than we are. For another, it has constituted a salty preservative for his work, among those who can appreciate it...an enlightening book.&#39; A.L.Rowse, The Standard.</p><p>This dictionary examines previously unnoted puns on the erotic attitudes and practices of the heterosexual and homosexual, the sexual deviant, and the impotent. It includes scatological puns in their usually bawdy contexts and ethnic puns, as sexually snide then as now. It stresses the need to read and hear Shakespeare word by word, giving full weight to each one and asking why the line is so and not otherwise. It heightens our awareness of Shakespeare&#39;s words, their Elizabethan connotations and their contemporary validity. For today&#39;s non-specialist audiences, the sexual puns are invitations to the fun of Shakespeare.</p><h2>Hiroshi Sugimoto: Architecture</h2><p><p><strong>The latest in Damiani and MW Editions' Sugimoto project collects his majestic images of classic modernist buildings</strong></p><p>In 1997, Hiroshi Sugimoto (born 1948) began a series of photographs of significant works of modernist architecture, intending &#x201c;to trace the beginnings of our age via architecture.&#x201d; One of the hallmarks of Sugimoto&#x2019;s work is his technical mastery of the medium. He makes photographs exclusively with an 8 x 10" view camera, and his silver gelatin prints are renowned for their tonal range, total lack of grain, wealth of detail and overall optical precision. In making the <i>Architecture</i> photographs, however, he inverted his usual process: &#x201c;Pushing out my old large-format camera&#x2019;s focal length to twice-infinity ... I discovered that superlative architecture survives the onslaught of blurred photography. Thus I began erosion-testing architecture for durability, completely melting away many of the buildings in the process.&#x201d;<br>In this volume, which includes 19 previously unpublished images, the language of architectural modernism is distilled in photographs of Le Corbusier&#x2019;s Villa Savoye, Mies van der Rohe&#x2019;s Seagram Building and Frank Gehry&#x2019;s Guggenheim Bilbao. By virtue of their blurriness and lack of color, the images strip down buildings to their essence, what we might imagine was the architect&#x2019;s first, pure vision of form. The details of construction and imperfections that are a natural result of a massive, collaborative human undertaking are absent, and instead light and shadow define the forms of these buildings. The <i>Architecture</i> photographs continue the artist&#x2019;s longstanding investigations of the passage of time and history. Are these monuments to human ingenuity and the power of the industrial age as eternal as they seem?</p></p><p></p><h2>Official TOEFL iBT Tests</h2><p><b>Five <i>more</i> authentic <i>TOEFL iBT�</i> tests in print and on DVD-ROM -- from ETS, the makers of the test!<p></p></b><p>This book contains five actual retired <i>TOEFL�</i> test forms with authentic reading, listening, speaking, and writing questions.

Unfortunately, Agnes cannot anticipate the hardship, humiliation, and loneliness that await her in the brutish Bloomfield and haughty Murray households. Drawn from Anne Bront�&#x2019;s own experiences, <i>Agnes Grey</i> depicts the harsh conditions and class snobbery that governesses were often forced to endure. As Barbara A. Suess writes in her Introduction, &#x201c;Bront� provides a portrait of the governess that is as sympathetic as her fictional indictment of the shallow, selfish moneyed class is biting.&#x201d;</p><p>This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

Ginny had picked up that gossip months ago, but she is shocked when the next morning's papers report that Kelsey was found murdered behind the very bar where Ginny and Bev had met. Worried that her friend could be implicated, Ginny decides to track down Kelsey's killer and also contacts a lawyer, Susan Coogan. Susan takes an immediate, intense liking to Ginny, complicating Ginny's relationship with her live-in lover. Meanwhile Ginny's inquiries heat up when she learns the Feds suspected Kelsey of embezzling from her employer. Woven into the narrative are observations on lesbian life and on prejudice, which are undercut when the author resorts to stereotyping: Ginny's boss, for example, is a drunken Irishman. Still, an entertaining assortment of female characters makes Baker's debut promising, even though the plot's logic does not stand up to close scrutiny: the police do not suspect Bev of the murder, making Ginny's sleuthing to save her friend appear superfluous. <p></p><p>Copyright 1991 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Turtle Geometry: The Computer as a Medium for Exploring</h2><p><i>Turtle Geometry</i> presents an innovative program of mathematical discovery that demonstrates how the effective use of personal computers can profoundly change the nature of a student's contact with mathematics.

What is truth? Are we free to choose to think or act? What is consciousness? Is human cloning justifiable? These are just some of the questions philosophers have attempted to answer, striking right at the heart of what it means to be human.

Grade 9 Up&#x2013;A daunting subject? Perhaps, but no browser will be able to resist the stunning design here: gorgeous full-color photos, many text boxes, and concise captions that inform and interest. These and the lucid writing, with multiple examples and illuminating analogies, will engage readers and provoke them into thought before they know it. Six big questions provide overall structure: what is reality? the mind? knowledge? morality? society? Is there a God? Six contributors (edited into stylistic consistency) tease out dozens of related issues: free will, infinity, language, sex, science, democracy, globalization, etc. One- to three-page entries that summarize the contributions of thinkers from Plato through John Locke and Benedict Spinoza to Rudolf Carnap, Jerry Fodor, and John Rawls appear with the issues or questions that most absorbed them. Many philosophers are mentioned in passing, as the writers cover huge swaths of intellectual territory with clarity but also with a sense of the depths yet to plumb. This work is both accessible and challenging: the lexicon is demanding, and the ideas will provide mental exercise for all readers. Logic, at the least, is one of the most useful tools for everyday problem-solving: the more minds exposed to philosophical methods and inquiry, the better for humanity. This most attractive volume makes its discipline irresistible.<i>&#x2013;Patricia D.

Online games, especially massively multiplayer online role-playing games (or MMORPGs for short), suffer from these security problems directly.</p> <p>MMORPGs are made of very sophisticated software built around a massively distributed client-server architecture. Because these games push the limits of software technology, especially when it comes to state and time (not to mention the real-time interaction of hundreds of thousands of users), they are particularly interesting as a case study in software security. In fact, MMORPGs are a harbinger of technical software security issues to come. Modern software of all kinds (not just game software) is evolving to be massively distributed, with servers interacting with and providing services for thousands of users at once. The move to Web Services and Service Oriented Architectures built using technologies like AJAX and Ruby follows hard on the heels of online games. What we learn here today is bound to be widely applicable tomorrow in every kind of software.</p> <p>Adding to the urgency of the security problem is the fact that online games are big business. The most popular MMORPG in the world, World of Warcraft by Blizzard Entertainment, has over 8 million users, each of whom pay $14 per month for the privilege of playing. Analysts estimate the gaming market will reach $12 billion by 2009.</p> <p>Inside the virtual worlds created by MMORPGs, simple data structures come to have value, mostly a reflection of the time gamers spend playing the game. Players accumulate and trade virtual wealth (or play money). Many of these virtual economies have per capita GDPs greater than most small nations. Not surprisingly, direct connections between the virtual economies of games and the real economy exist all over the place. Until recently, it was possible to buy in-game play money with real dollars on eBay; now many other well-developed middle markets exist. And the reverse is possible, too. This has led to the emergence of a class of players more interested in wringing virtual wealth out of the game than playing the game itself.</p> <p>Wherever money is at stake, criminals gather and linger. Cheating happens. In the case of MMORPGs, cheaters have real economic incentive to break the security of the game in order to accumulate virtual items and experience points for their characters. Many of these items and even the characters themselves are then sold off to the highest bidder.</p> <p>Sophisticated hackers have been working the fertile fields of MMORPGs for years, some of them making a living directly from gaming (or cheating at gaming). This book describes explicitly and in a technical way the kinds of attacks and techniques used by hackers who target games.</p> <p><b>Why Are We Doing This?</b></p> <p>As you can imagine, game companies take a dim view of cheating in their games. If cheating becomes rampant in a game, unsatisfied noncheating players will simply move on to another. Game developers have taken a number of steps to improve security in their games, some of them controversial (monitoring game players' PCs behind the scenes), others legalistic (imposing strict software license agreements and terms of use), and some of them trivial to break (using symmetric cryptography but including the secret key in the game client code). Our hope is that by understanding the kinds of attacks and hacking techniques described in this book, game developers will do a better job with online game security.</p> <p>We think our topic is important for several reasons: First, real money is at stake; second, many players are completely unaware of what is going on; and third, online game software security has many critical lessons that we can directly apply to other, more important software. Plus, it's fun and controversial.</p> <p>For example, some game companies have been known to use stealthytechniques most often seen in rootkits to monitor gamers' PCs. They havealso been known to resort to strong-arm tactics to suppress hackers, eventhose not attempting in any way to be malicious or to make money. Willmanufacturers of other software or digital content adopt these techniquesfor themselves?</p> <p>Not only are the technical issues captivating, the legal issues surrounding online games and their creative software license terms are also a harbinger of things to come. The legal battles between game companies, academics, and users are by no means over--in fact, they have just begun.</p> <p>In the end, the topic of online game security poses a number of interesting questions, the most pressing one being this: How do you balance gamers' privacy rights against game developers' desires to prevent their games from being hacked?</p> <p><b>Where Do We Draw the Line?</b></p> <p>For the record, we do not condone cheating, malicious hacking, or any other game-related shenanigans. We are most interested in deeply understanding and discussing what's going on in online game security. As practical security experts, we believe that only by gaining direct technical understanding of what happens when games are exploited can we begin to build systems that can withstand real attacks. Because in this situation money is at stake, you can be sure that attacks and exploits today are both concerted and organized.</p> <p>We think it is acceptable and necessary to understand both how games really work and how they fail. The only way to do this is to study them carefully. We pull no punches technically in this book, showing you how online game clients fail from a security perspective in living detail. We also explicitly describe techniques that can be used to exploit online games. We don't do this to create an army of online game hackers--that army is already brimming in numbers, and those already enlisted in it are unlikely to learn much from this book. We do this so that the good guys will know what they are really up against. Our main objective is to describe the kinds of weapons the existing active army of game attackers has.</p> <p>In our research for this book, we have broken no laws. We expect our readers likewise not to break the law using the techniques we describe.</p> <p><b>What's in the Book?</b></p> <p>Like most books, this book starts out at a high level and becomes progressively more technical as it goes on.</p> <p>Chapter 1, Why Games?, poses and answers some simple questions. How big are online games? How many people play? Why would anyone want to exploit them? What motivation is there to cheat in an online game? The answers to these questions will likely surprise you. Believe it or not, 10 million people play online games, billions of dollars are at stake, and some people even cheat for a living. We also provide a gentle introduction to game architecture in Chapter 1, describing the classic client-server model that most games use.</p> <p>Things get more technical beginning in Chapter 2, Game Hacking 101, where we describe the very basics of game hacking. The chapter is organized around describing six basic techniques: (1) building a bot, (2) using the user interface, (3) operating a proxy, (4) manipulating memory, (5) drawing on a debugger, and (6) finding the future. We pay special attention to the topic of bots since most game exploits exist to create and operate them. Late in the chapter, we even show a very simple bot that we built so you can see exactly what bot software looks like. We then describe controversial moves taken by one game maker to thwart cheating--installing rootkit-like spyware on a gamer's PC to keep track of what's going on. We hold this approach in low opinion and have written a program to help you know what's going on with these monitoring programs on your own machine. We believe game makers would be better off spending their resources to build games that were less broken than to build monitoring technology.</p> <p>The next two chapters take a break from technical material to cover money and the law. In particular, Chapter 3, Money, helps us understand why some players might want to cheat. The recent book Play Money by Julian Dibbell (Basic Books, 2006) describes one (pathetic) man's foray into professional game farming, something that a number of people actively pursue. There is enough money in play here that entire enterprises have grown up around providing middleman services for gamers, buying and selling virtual items in a marketplace. The biggest and most interesting company, Internet Gaming Entertainment, known as IGE to most people, deserves and gets a treatment of its own in this chapter.</p> <p>Chapter 4, Enter the Lawyers, is about the law. Game companies (and indeed a whole host of other software makers) have created a licensing jungle in the form of end user license agreements (EULAs) and terms of use (TOU) documents. Though we are not lawyers, and by no means should you rely on our advice, we provide a brief description of U.S. copyright law and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Then we go through an entertaining (and somewhat scary) parade of EULAs gone bad--from Sony's rootkit debacle to viruses protected by EULAs. We end up with a discussion of your rights as a software user and gamer.</p> <p>Technical aspects of online game security begin to pick back up in Chapter 5, Infested with Bugs. We spend this chapter talking about the kinds of vulnerabilities found in many games, explaining how attackers use them to build working exploits. We pay particular attention to bugs involving time and state, which, as we alluded to earlier, are the kinds of bugs we can expect to see much more of as other software evolves to become more like game software.</p> <p>Chapter 6, Hacking Game Clients, really digs in and gets technical. As we move more deeply into games, we are forced to use a game or two as a particular target. We don't do this to single out any one game; instead, we do this to make our examples salient and technical. We have chosen to concentrate on World of Warcraft (WoW), a game produced by Blizzard Entertainment, mostly because it is the number one online game in the world. The kinds of techniques we demonstrate using WoW as an example can be applied by analogy to almost any online game (and to modern Web 2.0 software, for that matter). Chapter 6 begins with a discussion of the attacker's toolkit (many of the tools we describe are standard software testing tools). We then organize our discussion of game hacking techniques into four equally important areas: (1) getting over the game by using its user interface directly, (2) getting inside the game by manipulating memory, (3) getting under the game by interposing on services like video drivers, and (4) getting way outside the game by intercepting and manipulating network traffic. </p> <p>Chapter 6 is in some sense the heart of the book, introducing a large number of techniques commonly used by game attackers. Chapter 6 has lots of data in it, probably too much. Sometimes it is easier to understand these kinds of techniques by seeing how they are put into practice. Toward that end, in Chapter 7, Building a Bot, we put together all of the lessons of Chapter 6. Chapter 7 is technical, with plenty of example code showing how the ideas in Chapter 6 work in concert to exploit a game.</p> <p>Chapter 8, Reversing, is even more technical, focusing its attention on reverse engineering techniques that many attackers use to exploit software. Though the techniques we describe in this chapter are intense, they are by no means new. As we describe in our book <i>Exploiting Software</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2004), disassemblers and decompilers are used in computer security every day, both by good guys and by bad guys.</p> <p>The final technical topic in our book is presented in Chapter 9, Advanced Game Hacking Fu. This chapter discusses what is known in the trade as total conversions and game mods. We describe the process by which some people take apart game data files in order to build their own games or combine different aspects of games in interesting ways. Though some game companies try hard to quash all discussion of total conversion, it happens anyway. We describe how.</p> <p>Of course, our purpose in this book is to help those who build games understand how to do a better job with security. Chapter 10, Software Security �ber Alles, provides a flyover of the new field of software security. Game developers would do well to adopt some of the best practices in common use in the financial vertical today. We also describe a set of questions that everyday gamers can ask their game companies about security. Our fervent hope is that this book will lead to more secure software--both in the game community and beyond.</p> <p><b>The Software Security Series</b></p> <p>This book is part of the Addison-Wesley Software Security Series of software security books for professional software developers.

A handful of countries have indeed succeeded in raising their respective population&#39;s general level of scientific knowledge, but in other countries, in spite of much effort, the shortage in supply of science-trained students persists, examination achievement levels remain low, and the cost of provision so high that many children all over the world are denied access to effective science teaching. Whilst the problems of curriculum relevance have been widely discussed, little attention has been paid to the issues confronting the policy-maker and the manager in deciding how much to invest in science education, how to provide value for money or how much science to provide for how many students. This book addresses the question of how best to plan investment in science at secondary level in developing countries using insights from the studies conducted under a five-year research programme carried out by the International Institute for Educational Planning. The result is an extensive account, commentary and analysis of the main issues that the planners of science education in developing countries are likely to be confronted with when addressing the challenges of the twenty-first century.</p><p>Francoise Caillods is a Senior Programme Specialist at the International Institute for Educational Planning/UNESCO.</p><h2>Canadian Literature In English: Texts and Contexts, Vol. 1</h2><p><p>This book differs from other anthologies of Canadian literature in its inclusion of substantial contextual material; its historical emphasis on the production of Canadian literature; its interdisciplinary approach; its emphasis on intertextual dialogue between selections; its inclusion of popular culture texts, such as song lyrics; and its inclusion of a substantial representation of Canadian First Nations writing within a general Canadian Literature anthology.</p></p><p></p><h2>Basic Elements of Real Analysis (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)</h2><p>From the author of the highly-acclaimed &#34;A First Course in Real Analysis&#34; comes a volume designed specifically for a short one-semester course in real analysis.

Finzel offers ideas for changes in leadership styles in the interest of creating a more dynamic work environment.</p><p>I originally wrote The Top Ten Mistakes Leaders Make in the early 1990s. I had just turned forty and was relatively young in my leadership experience as a new CEO. The success of this book over the years has been encouraging, especially since most books by unknown authors never go into a second printing. I have heard from so many readers who could empathize with the issues I brought up. Most of the people I hear from suffer in some way under leaders who still don't get it: the servant collab- orative leadership style. They write to say thank you for giving them hope and new ideas of how to do leadership right. With all that has been writ- ten about empowering leadership styles, my observation still holds true that it is not a natural part of human nature. Unless leaders are out there learning and opening themselves to different ideas on how to lead, most will continue to default toward top-down leadership.&nbsp;<b>Dr. Hans Finzel </b>is a successful author, teacher and leader among leaders. He has trained leaders internationally on five continents. Hans recently completed twenty years as President and CEO of international non-profit WorldVenture with a staff of 550 workers in 70 countries worldwide. Hans and his wife Donna spent ten years living in Vienna, Austria while training leaders throughout Eastern Europe behind the Iron Curtain before the fall of communism. Dr. Finzel is the author of seven books, including his bestseller "The Top Ten Mistakes Leaders Make". He and his wife have four grown children. They reside in Highlands Ranch, Colorado.</p><h2>The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (Essential.penguin S.)</h2><p>She was a schoolmistress with a difference. Proud, cultured, romantic, her ideas were progressive, even shocking. And when she decided to transform a group of young girls under her tutelage into the &#34;creme de la creme&#34; of Marcia Blaine school, no one could have predicted the outcome.</p><p>The brevity of Muriel Spark's novels is equaled only by their brilliance. These four novels, each a miniature masterpiece, illustrate her development over four decades. Despite the seriousness of their themes, all four are fantastic comedies of manners, bristling with wit.<br>Spark's most celebrated novel, THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE, tells the story of a charismatic schoolteacher's catastrophic effect on her pupils. THE GIRLS OF SLENDER MEANS" is a beautifully drawn portrait of young women living in a hostel in London in the giddy postwar days of 1945. THE DRIVER'S SEAT follows the final haunted hours of a woman descending into madness. And THE ONLY PROBLEM is a witty fable about suffering that brings the Book of Job to bear on contemporary terrorism. <br>All four novels give evidence of one of the most original and unmistakable voices in contemporary fiction. Characters are vividly etched in a few words; earth-shaking events are lightly touched on. Yet underneath the glittering surface there is an obsessive probing of metaphysical questions: the meaning of good and evil, the need for salvation, the search for significance.Muriel Spark&#39;s many novels include Memento Mori, The Girls of Slender Means, A Far Cry From Kensington, The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie (adapted for film and theatre), Aiding And Abetting and her final novel, The Finishing School. She was elected C. Litt in 1992 and awarded the DBE in 1993. Dame Muriel received many awards, including the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, the FNAC Prix Etranger, the Saltire Prize, the Ingersoll T. S. Eliot Award and the David Cohen British Literature Prize in recognition of a lifetime&#39;s literary achievement. Dame Muriel died in 2006.</p><h2>The Oxford Book of the American South: Testimony, Memory, and Fiction</h2><p><em>The Oxford Book of the American South</em> resonates with the words of black people and white, women and men, the powerless as well as the powerful. The collection presents the most telling fiction and nonfiction produced in the South from the late eighteenth century to the present. Renowned authors such as James Agee, Richard Wright, Maya Angelou, Lee Smith, Eudora Welty, William Faulkner, and Flannery O'Connor appear in these pages, but so do people whose writing did not immediately reach a large audience. For example, Harriet A. Jacobs' book Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, which is now recognized as one of the most illuminating narratives of a former slave, was neglected for generations. And Sarah Morgan's powerful Civil War Diary has only recently come to widespread attention. The Oxford Book of the American South presents compelling autobiographies, diaries, memoirs, and journalism as well as stories and selections from novels, and runs the spectrum from the conservative to the radical, the traditional to the innovative. Editors Edward L. Ayers and Bradley C. Mittendorf have arranged these diverse readings so that they fit together into a rich mosaic of Southern life and history. The sections of the book The Old South, The Civil War and Its Consequences, Hard Times, and The Turning unfold a vivid record of life below the Mason Dixon line. We see the antebellum period both from the perspective of those who experienced it first-hand, such as Thomas Jefferson and former slaves Olaudah Equiano and Frederick Douglass, and then from the perspective of authors looking back on that era, including William Styron and Sherley Anne Williams. Likewise, we see the Civil War through the eyes of witnesses such as Sam Watkins, through the eyes of later writers trying to make sense of the conflict, such as Robert Penn Warren, and through the eyes of those using the war's intense passions to fuel their fiction, such as Margaret Mitchell and Barry Hannah. The classic authors of the Southern Renaissance in the 1920s and 1930s appear here in the context of the hard times in which they wrote. The years since World War II are chronicled in the powerful words of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "Letter from Birmingham Jail," George Garrett's "Good bye, Good bye, Be Always Kind and True," and Peter Taylor's "The Decline and Fall of the Episcopal Church, in the Year of Our Lord 1952." The editors have selected these readings, their Preface tells us, to convey "the passions that have surfaced time and again in more than two hundred years of Southern writing." Indeed, the struggles, defeats, and triumphs chronicled in<em>The Oxford Book of the</em> <em>American South</em> speak not just to the South, but to all of the American experience. They document and evoke some of the most dramatic episodes in the nation's life</p><p><br><em>About the Editors:</em><br> <strong>Edward L. Ayers</strong>, born in North Carolina, was raised in Tennessee and attended the University of Tennessee and Yale University. Ayers has taught the history and culture of the American South at the University of Virginia since 1980. His The Promise of the New South won the Owsley Prize for the best book on the history of the South and was a finalist for both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize.<br> <strong>Bradley C. Mittendorf</strong>, born and raised in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is a writer and political consultant in his native town. He attended Louisiana State University and the University of Virginia and is currently working on a project concerning Robert Penn Warren.<br>Ayers (history, Univ. of Virginia) and Mittendorf, a writer and political consultant, here delve into both Southern fiction and nonfiction, trying to create a unified book rather than a series of unconnected writings by Southerners about the South. Diaries, memoirs, letters, and essays from over 50 writers from the Colonial period to the present represent a variety of social, racial, and gender groups. The anthology is divided into four sections that correspond to major periods of Southern history. A brief introductory essay by the editors relates the history of the era and establishes the emotional and philosophical mood of the times. Within each section, the editors have attempted to present the period as an unfolding drama, with eyewitness accounts followed by writers of subsequent generations who view the era. The editors acknowledge that several genres such as poetry, folklore, and professional history have been omitted because they could find no effective way to integrate them with the remainder of the volume. For a more specialized view, the multivolume Georgia Voices (Vol 1: LJ 11/1/92; Vol 2: LJ 7/94) offers the reader an excellent anthology.

At the time of its &#39;discovery&#39;, the American continent was identified as the Fourth World of our planet. In the course of just a few centuries its original inhabitants, though settled there for millennia and countable in many millions, have come to be perceived as a marginal if not entirely dispensable factor in the continent&#39;s destiny. Today the term has been taken up again by its native peoples, to describe their own world: both its threatened present condition, and its political history, which stretches back thousands of years before Columbus. In order to explore the literature of this world, Brotherston uses primary sources that have traditionally been ignored because they have not conformed to Western definitions of oral and written literature, such as the scrolls of the Algonkin, the knotted strings (Quipus) of the Inca, Navajo dry-paintings and the encyclopedic pages of Meso-America&#39;s screenfold books.</p><p>The Book of the Fourth World offers detailed analyses of texts that range far back into the centuries of civilised life from what is now Latin- and Anglo-America.

Today the term has been taken up again by its &#34;Indian&#34; or native peoples to describe their own world - both its threatened present condition and its political history, which stretches back thousands of years before Columbus. Using indigenous sources as primary sources, Book of the Fourth World explores the landscapes and chronologies of this world as they have been seen and interpreted from the inside. Mapping the continent by this literary means, it pays particular attention to the well-documented traditions of the Nahuatl (Aztec) and Maya to the north of the isthmus, and of the Quechua-speaking Inca to the South. According to both the literary evidence and the testimony of native Americans themselves, notably at the Quito Conference of July 1990, an underlying coherence is to be found in the creation story told in the &#34;bible of America&#34;, the Popol vuh of the Quiche Maya. A classic of world literature, this 16th-century work sets out a story of evolution understood by Europe only hundreds of years later; its natural philosophy is now being defended, as a way of life critical to that of the planet itself, in the tropical forests of the Amazon. Taking a skeptical view of the 1992 quincentenary and respecting the testimony of the Indians themselves, this study brings together a wide range of evidence from what is now Latin and Anglo America. In doing so, it offers detailed analyses of texts ranging far back into the centuries of civilized life that antedated Columbus.</p><h2>Contemporary Engineering Economics</h2><p><p> <i>Contemporary Engineering Economics, 5/e, </i>is intended for undergraduate engineering students taking introductory engineering economics while appealing to the full range of engineering disciplines for which this course is often required: industrial, civil, mechanical, electrical, computer, aerospace, chemical, and manufacturing engineering, as well as engineering technology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This edition has been thoroughly revised and updated while continuing to adopt a contemporary approach to the subject, and teaching, of engineering economics.

During the last twenty years, Maurice Godelier has spent many long periods of time living among this people, and in this book he presents a detailed account of their lives and their forms of social organization. The focus of the book is on inequality and power in this classless society. Godelier discusses both the power that certain men (the Great men) have over others through their control of war, shamanism, hunting, and rites of initiation, as well as the extraordinary power and domination that men in general exert over women. He explores how this domination is produced and maintained, examining it in particular through a detailed study of male and female initiation. He also analyzes the role that sexuality plays in Baruya thought and theories, showing that in the Baruya view, every aspect of domination - be it (in Western categorization) economic, political, or symbolic - can be explained by sexuality, and the different role of the sexes in human reproduction. A major contribution both to the ethnography of Melanesia and to anthropological theory, the book will interest scholars and students of anthropology, as well as other readers interested in power and inequality, and in the relationships between the sexes.</p><p>This portrayal of the classless Baruya society of Papua New Guinea explores the nature of male domination through a detailed study of male and female initiation rites as well as other expressions of sexuality in Baruya thought and theory.

These two values enable us to see and feel the space, form, structure, perspective and texture around us." Author and artist Chinkok Tan has developed an easy-to-teach and easy-to-learn method for painting watercolor that will allow anyone to achieve good results with a minimum of study time. <p>Tan combines his clear teaching on seeing color values in light with an equally clear and simple teaching on seeing shapes properly. His three-step painting process develops the form of an object by adding shade and detail, while still keeping the process simple for the beginner. This method eliminates the need for complicated courses in drawing, anatomy, perspective and color theory. </p><p>* Helps simplify the process of watercolor painting without simplifying the results<br> * Teaches how to paint directly and immediately using shapes and light values</p></p><p>Chinkok Tan has painted and taught for more than 40 years. In <i>Watercolor Basics: Shape and Light Value,</i> he shows the art student how to see and simplify one's subjects. Tan suggests that every subject "reveals itself in light values and shapes. When you finish this book, you should be able to paint anything without sketching." An introduction to supplies provides the tools needed to get started for under 80 dollars, and a primer on techniques describes painting sources and how to lay a flat wash. Tan begins his lessons by explaining light values (color) and how to mix them. He teaches the painter to abandon outlining one's subjects and to instead focus on painting correct shapes and silhouettes. He then presents a three-step process of painting shape, shade, and detail; how to use higher or lower values for varying effects; and how to build harmonious compositions. The book closes with complete step-by-step painting demonstrations. Tan's method is simple, straightforward, and easy to grasp, yet he achieves surprisingly sophisticated and refreshing painted effects, as in the waxy sheen of green and red apples poised in a luminous glass bowl. Tan asserts, "I can say with absolute certainty that painting is a skill anybody with interest can learn. It has nothing to do with talent or gift." This book of basic techniques is ideal for the beginning painter, but will also prove of benefit to more experienced artists who wish to revisit fundamental lessons of perception and "trusting the eye." <i>--Mary Ribesky</i>Chinkok Tan is a very popular workshop instructor.

Henry <br>The Making of a New Yorker<br><br></b>Besides many things, Raggles was a poet. He was called a tramp; but that was only an elliptical way of saying that he was a philosopher, an artist, a traveler, a naturalist, and a discoverer. But most of all he was a poet. In all his life he never wrote a line of verse; he lived his poetry. His Odyssey would have been a Limerick, had it been written. But, to linger with the primary proposition, Raggles was a poet.<br><br>Raggles's specialty, had he been driven to ink and paper, would have been sonnets to the cities. He studied cities as women study their reflections in mirrors; as children study the glue and sawdust of a dislocated doll; as the men who write about wild animals study cages in the zoo. A city to Raggles was not merely a pile of bricks and mortar, peopled by a certain number of inhabitants; it was a thing with soul characteristic and distinct; an individual conglomeration of life, with its own peculiar essence, flavor, and feeling. Two thousand miles to the north, south, east and west, Raggles wandered in poetic fervor, taking the cities to his breast. He footed it on dusty roads, or sped magnificently in freight cars, counting time as of no account. And when he had found the heart of a city and listened to its secret confession, he strayed on, restless, to another. Fickle Raggles!&#x2014;but perhaps he had not met the civic corporation that could engage and hold his fancy.<br><br>Through the ancient poets we have learned that the cities are feminine. So they were to poet Raggles; and his mind carried a concrete and clear conception of the figure that symbolized and typified each one that he had wooed.<br><br>Chicago seemed to swoop down upon him with a breezy suggestion of Mrs. Partington, plumes and patchouli, and to disturb his rest with a soaring and beautiful song of future promise. But Raggles would awake to a sense of shivering cold and a haunting impression of ideals lost in a depressing aura of potato salad and fish.<br><br>Pittsburgh impressed him as the play of "Othello" performed in the Russian language in a railroad station by Dockstader's minstrels A royal and generous lady this Pittsburgh, though&#x2014;homely, hearty, with flushed face, washing the dishes in a silk dress and white kid slippers, and bidding Raggles sit before the roaring fireplace and drink champagne with his pigs' feet and fried potatoes.<br><br>New Orleans simply gazed down upon him from a balcony. He could see her pensive, starry eyes and catch the flutter of her fan, and that was all. Only once he came face to face with her. It was dawn, when she was flushing the red bricks of the banquette with a pail of water. She laughed and hummed a chansonette and filled Raggles's shoes with ice-cold water. Allons!<br><br>Boston construed herself to the poetic Raggles in an erratic and singular way. It seemed to him that he had drunk cold tea and that the city was a white, cold cloth that had been bound tightly around his brow to spur him to some unknown but tremendous mental effort. And, after all, he came to shovel snow for a livelihood; and the cloth, becoming wet, tightened its knots and could not be removed.<br><br>Indefinite and unintelligable ideas, you will say; but your disapprobation should be tempered with gratitude, for these are poets' fancies&#x2014;and suppose you had come upon them in verse!<br><br>One day Raggles came and laid siege to the heart of the great city of Manhattan. She was the greatest of all; and he wanted to learn her note in the scale; to taste and appraise and classify and solve and label her and arrange her with the other cities that had given him up the secret of their individuality. And here we cease to be Raggles's translator and become his chronicler.<br><br>Raggles landed from a ferry-boat one morning and walked into the core of the town with the blas� air of a cosmopolite. He was dressed with care to play the r�le of an "unidentified man." No country, race, class, clique, union, party, clan, or bowling association could have claimed him. His clothing, which had been donated to him piece-meal by citizens of different height, but same number of inches around the heart, was not yet as uncomfortable to his figure as those specimens of raiment, self-measured, that are railroaded to you by trans-continental tailors with a suitcase, suspenders, silk handkerchief and pearl studs as a bonus. Without money&#x2014;as a poet should be&#x2014;but with the ardor of an astronomer discovering a new star in the chorus of the milky way, or a man who has seen ink suddenly flow from his fountain pen, Raggles wandered into the great city.<br><br>Late in the afternoon he drew out of the roar and commotion with a look of dumb terror on his countenance. He was defeated puzzled, discomfited, frightened. Other cities had been to him as long primers to read; as country maidens quickly to fathom; as send-price-of-subscription-with-answer rebuses to solve; as oyster cocktails to swallow; but her was one as cold, glittering, serene, impossible as a four-carat diamond in a window to a lover outside fingering damply in his pocket his ribbon-counter salary.<br><br>The greetings of the other cities he had known&#x2014;their homespun kindliness, their human gamut of rough charity, friendly curses, garrulous curiosity, and easily estimated credulity or indifference. This city of Manhattan gave him no clue; it was walled against him. Like a river of adamant it flowed past him in the streets. Never an eye was turned upon him; no voice spoke to him. His heart yearned for the clap of Pittsburgh's sooty yawp in his ear; for the pale and eleemosynary stare through the Bostonian eyeglass&#x2014;even for the precipitate but unmalicious boot-toe of Louisville or St. Louis.<br><br>On Broadway Raggles, successful suitor of many cities, stood, bashful, like any country swain. For the first time he experienced the poignant humiliation of being ignored. And when he tried to reduce this brilliant, swiftly changing, ice-cold city to a formula he failed utterly. Poet though he was, it offered him no color similes, no points of comparison, no flaw in its polished facets, no handle by which he could hold it up and view its shape and structure, as he familiarly and often contemptuously had done with other towns. The houses were interminable ramparts loopholed for defense; the people were bright but bloodless specters passing in sinister and selfish array.<br><br>The thing that weighed heaviest on Raggles's soul and clogged his poet's fancy was the spirit of absolute egotism that seemed to saturate the people as toys ar saturated with paint. Each one that he considered appeared a monster of abominable and insolent conceit. Humanity was gone from them; they were toddling idols of stone and varnish, worshiping themselves and greedy for though oblivious of worship from their fellow graven images. Frozen, cruel, implacable, impervious, cut to an identical pattern, they hurried on their ways like statues brought by some miracle to motion, while soul and feeling lay unaroused in the reluctant marble. <br><br>Gradually Raggles became conscious of certain types. One was an elderly gentleman with a snow-white, short beard, ink, unwrinkled face, and stony, sharp blue eyes, attired in the fashion of a gilded youth, who seemed to personify the city's wealth, ripeness and frigid unconcern. Another type was a woman, tall, beautiful, clear as a steel engraving, goddess-like, calm, clothed like the princesses of old, with eyes as coldly blue as the reflection of sunlight on a glacier.&nbsp; And another was a by-product of this town of marionettes&#x2014;a broad, swaggering, grim, threateningly sedate fellow, with a jowl as large as a harvested wheat field, the complexion of a baptized infant, and the knuckles of a prize-fighter. This type leaned against cigar signs and viewed the world with frapp�d contumely.<br><br>A poet is a sensitive creature, and Raggles soon shriveled in the bleak embrace of the undecipherable. The chill, sphinx-like, ironical, illegible, unnatural, ruthless expression of the city left him downcast and bewildered. Had it no heart? Better the woodpile, the scolding of vinegar-faced housewives at back doors, the kindly spleen of bartenders behind provincial free-lunch counters, the amiable truculence of rural constables, the kicks, arrests, and happy-go-lucky chances of the other vulgar, loud, crude cities than this freezing heartlessness.<br><br>Raggles summoned his courage and sought alms from the populace. Unheeding, regardless, they passed on without the wink of an eyelash tot testify that they were conscious of his existence. And then he said to himself that this fair but pitiless city of Manhattan was without a soul; that its inhabitants were mannikins moved by wires and springs, and that he was alone in a great wilderness.<br><br>Raggles started to cross the street. There was a blast, a roar, a hissing, and a crash as something struck him and hurled him over and over six yards from where he had been. As he was coming down like a stick of a rocket the earth and all the cities thereof turned to a fractured dream. <br><br>Raggles opened his eyes. First an odor made itself known to him&#x2014;an odor of the earliest spring flowers of Paradise. And then a hand soft as a falling petal touched his brow. Bending over him was a woman clothed like the princess of old, with blue eyes, now soft and humid with human sympathy. Under his head on the pavement were silks and furs. With Raggles's hat in his hand and with his face pinker than ever from a vehement outburst of oratory against reckless driving, stood the elderly gentleman who personified the city's wealth and ripeness. From a nearby caf� hurried the by-product with the vast jowl and baby complexion, bearing a glass full of crimson fluid that suggest delightful possibilities. <br><br>"Drink dis, sport," said the by-product, holding the glass to Raggles's lips.<br><br>Hundreds of people huddled around in a moment, their faces wearing the deepest concern. Two flattering and gorgeous policemen got into the circle and pressed back the over-plus of Samaritans. An old lady in a black shawl spoke loudly of camphor; a newsboy slipped one of his papers beneath Raggles's elbow, where it lay on the muddy pavement.

Antonakos' metier is neon, and Sandler believes that his Greek heritage and early years in 1920s rural Greece inspired his fascination with light. The artist concurs but notes that as much as the "powerful, clear natural light" of Greece may have imprinted itself on his child's psyche, he remembers most vividly the richly colored interior of the church near his home. Many of his pieces for enclosed spaces have a sort of stained-glass radiance, but Antonakos, who is as much a technical innovator as a master of form and color, also transforms outdoor space with his large, open-air constructions. Sandler's skillful chronicle and analysis of Antonakos' 40-year exploration of the properties of light are accompanied by 257 spectacular colorplates. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Swiped: How to Protect Yourself in a World Full of Scammers, Phishers, and Identity Thieves</h2><p><b>Identity fraud happens to everyone. So what do you do when it's your turn?</b><br><br>Increasingly, identity theft is a fact of life. We might once have hoped to protect ourselves from hackers with airtight passwords and aggressive spam filters, and those are good ideas as far as they go. But with the breaches of huge organizations like Target, AshleyMadison.com, JPMorgan Chase, Sony, Anthem, and even the US Office of Personnel Management, more than a billion personal records have already been stolen, and chances are good that you're already in harm's way.<br><br>This doesn't mean there's no hope. Your identity may get stolen, but it doesn't have to be a life-changing event. Adam Levin, a longtime consumer advocate and identity fraud expert, provides a method to help you keep hackers, phishers, and spammers from becoming your problem.<br><br>Levin has seen every scam under the sun: fake companies selling credit card insurance&#x201d;; criminal, medical, and child identity theft; emails that promise untold riches for some personal information; catphishers, tax fraud, fake debt collectors who threaten you with legal action to confirm your account numbers; and much more. As Levin shows, these folks get a lot less scary if you see them coming.<br><br>With a clearheaded, practical approach, <i>Swiped</i> is your guide to surviving the identity theft epidemic.

After Peter was put to death during the reign of Emperor Nero, Mark decided to record everything Peter had told him about Jesus and create his Gospel account of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ. Mark shows us that no matter how chaotic our world becomes, we can always cling to the hope and peace that we have in Jesus. Even in the darkest of times, we can rely on the light of Christ to see us through.

Today's problems are a new breed&#x2015;open, complex, dynamic, and networked&#x2015;and require a radically different response. In this book, Kees Dorst describes a new, innovation-centered approach to problem-solving in organizations: frame creation. It applies &#x201c;design thinking,&#x201d; but it goes beyond the borrowed tricks and techniques that usually characterize that term. Frame creation focuses not on the generation of solutions but on the ability to create new approaches to the problem situation itself.</p><p>The strategies Dorst presents are drawn from the unique, sophisticated, multilayered practices of top designers, and from insights that have emerged from fifty years of design research. Dorst describes the nine steps of the frame creation process and illustrates their application to real-world problems with a series of varied case studies. He maps innovative solutions that include rethinking a store layout so retail spaces encourage purchasing rather than stealing, applying the frame of a music festival to understand late-night problems of crime and congestion in a club district, and creative ways to attract young employees to a temporary staffing agency. Dorst provides tools and methods for implementing frame creation, offering not so much a how-to manual as a do-it-yourself handbook&#x2015;a guide that will help practitioners develop their own approaches to problem-solving and creating innovation.</p></p><p>Kees Dorst is Professor of Design Innovation at the University of Technology, Sydney. He is the author of <i>Understanding Design: 175 Reflections on Being a Designer</i> and the coauthor of <i>Design Expertise</i>.<p>Kees Dorst manages in his new book <i>Frame Innovation: Create New Thinking by Design</i> to provide a practical new approach to design-led innovation. His frame creation approach enables the addressing of difficult and wicked problems through the use of design thinking. All managers who run firms that want to compete on value rather than cost should familiarize themselves with this approach. I commend this book to the global business community.</p>&#x2015;<b>G�ran Roos</b>, Professor in Strategic Design, Faculty of Design, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia; coauthor of <i>Managing Intellectual Capital in Practice</i><br><br><p>Studies show that a key aspect of the creative ways in which designers think and work is problem-framing, or generating perspectives that engender new understanding of the problem and offer bridges to new solutions. Kees Dorst skillfully explains and develops this concept, illustrates its application with real, complex, and contemporary examples, and shows how teams and organizations can work in this creative, innovative, and designerly way.</p>&#x2015;<b>Nigel Cross</b>, Emeritus Professor of Design Studies, The Open University, UK<br><br><p>A fascinating journey into problem-solving for the twenty-first century.

Lucidly organized and skillfully written, <i>The Camphor Flame</i> brings clarity to an immensely complicated subject. C. J.

Alain Badiou experienced that primitive terror when he, with his young friends, made up a game called "The Stroke of Midnight." The furtive discovery of the dark continent of sex in banned magazines, the beauty of black ink on paper, but also the mysteries of space and the grief of mourning: these are some of the things we encounter as the philosopher takes us on a trip through the private theater of his mind, at the whim of his memories. Music, painting, politics, sex, and metaphysics: all contribute to making black more luminous than it has ever been.</p></p><p><b>Alain Badiou</b> is a writer, philosopher, and an Emeritus Professor at the �cole n Normale Sup�rieure, Paris.<p>&#x201c;Badiou&#x2019;s Black is a singular and remarkable book. This is not the Badiou of ontology, set theory and the theorization of subjectivity, nor the Badiou of incisive political intervention or philosophical-historical summation. Working through a series of ficto-critical vignettes, Black is composed of subtle and diverse meditations on black as a darkness that obscures at the same time as it discloses. Black at once hearkens back to a style of personal philosophy that seemed lost with Blanchot, while also looking forward to a new mode of singular meditation that is perhaps necessary for twenty-first-century thought.&#x201d;<br><b> Claire Colebrook, Penn State University<br><br></b>"Alain Badiou's&nbsp;<i>Black:&nbsp;The Brilliance of a Noncolor</i> is a radical departure for the impenetrable thinker of Theory of the Subject and Being and Event. It's more in the tradition of Maurice Blanchot (or even Alexander Theroux, Mark Rothko) than Lacan or Althusser and casts an evocative pall over the way text, thought, and flesh have come to negotiate dark and light (black/white)."<b><br>Minor Literatures<br></b></p></p><h2>Mathematical Excursions</h2><p>MATHEMATICAL EXCURSIONS, Third Edition, teaches students that mathematics is a system of knowing and understanding our surroundings. For example, sending information across the Internet is better understood when one understands prime numbers; the perils of radioactive waste take on new meaning when one understands exponential functions; and the efficiency of the flow of traffic through an intersection is more interesting after seeing the system of traffic lights represented in a mathematical form. Students will learn those facets of mathematics that strengthen their quantitative understanding and expand the way they know, perceive, and comprehend their world.

I'd heard at church that the kingdom of heaven is within us and thought, Yeah, sure. But the first time I walked up a trout stream, fly rod in hand, I didn't feel I was 'outside' at all: I was traveling further and further in." An estimated three thousand river walks later comes <b>My Story as Told by Water</b>, in which Duncan braids his contemplative, activist, and rhapsodic voices together into an irresistibly distinctive whole, speaking with a power and urgency that will recharge our national appreciation of the vital connections between our water-filled bodies and this water-covered planet.<br><br>Offering a wide-ranging, contemplative exploration of the rivers that touch his life, Duncan backs his insights with a fierce defense of the sacred cultures and fauna that living waters sustain. With a bracing blend of story, logic, science, and comedy, he dissects the hollow industrial platitudes that lead to the ruin of publicly owned rivers for private profit. Standing up for the river made famous by the pen of his neighbor, Norman Maclean, Duncan exposes America's anachronistic federal mining policy and the devastating cyanide technology to which it has led. As an advocate for the bankrupted fishing towns, Native tribes, and unraveling web of life of the Pacific Northwest, he lays bare our biological and religious obligation to breach four of the Columbia and the Snake rivers' 221 massive dams to save wild salmon. Yet Duncan centers even his darkest explorations in the joys, gratitude, and wonder that walking rivers, rod in hand, provides him.<br><br>Here is a brilliant writer revealing captivating speculations on being born lost, on the discovery of water, on wading as pilgrimage, coho as interior compass, and industrial creeks as blues tunes. Here are rivers perceived as prayer wheels, dying birds as prophets, salmon as life-givers, brown trout as role models, wilderness as our true home, wonder as true ownership, and justice as biologically and spiritually inescapable.</p><p>When David James Duncan was growing up in suburban Portland, Oregon, he had no river to call his own, so he would routinely create one by flooding his mother's garden with a hose. He would then revel in his creation until he received the inevitable scolding. The poor kid couldn't help himself: "Running water ... felt as necessary to me as food, sleep, parents, and air," he explains. In time, he exchanged his nozzle for a fly rod and went in search of grander gardens, eventually developing an "interior coho compass" which he has traveled by ever since. <p> As any reader of <i>The River Why</i> knows, Duncan is a master of the art of writing about fishing--which is also to say life, since the two for him are indelibly linked. But these essays deal with far more than leaky waders and rising trout. Part memoir, part activist treatise, <i>My Story As Told by Water</i> is Duncan's love song to wild places and the creatures which inhabit them. The book's highlight is his powerfully convincing essay "A Prayer for the Salmon's Second Coming," in which he argues that saving salmon is crucial to both man and fish alike: "A 'modern Northwest' that cannot support salmon is unlikely to support 'modern Northwesterners' for long," he writes. In this elegant demand for the removal of four Snake River dams (out of 221 on the Snake/Columbia system), Duncan declares the wild salmon "a holiness, a divine gift," a role model rather than a resource: "Salmon are a light darting not just through water, but through the human mind and heart. Salmon help shield us from fear of death by showing us how to follow our course without fear, and how to give ourselves for the sake of things greater than ourselves." </p><p> He also ruminates on the true meanings of "place" and "home"; offers a fable on the 1872 Mining Act, "the most anachronistic and devastating piece of 'corporate welfare' in the world"; and details how Montanans rallied to prevent a giant mining company from extracting gold near the Blackfoot River, the setting of the Norman Maclean classic <i>A River Runs Through It</i>. All in all, <i>My Story As Told by Water</i> is a moving collection by an exquisite writer endowed with wit, compassion, and the rare ability to appeal to both emotion and reason in equal measures. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p>"This book is the <i>Desert Solitaire</i> of water."--Jim Harrison<br><br>"Original, skillful, and funny as hell."--Ian Frazier<br><br>"<i>My Story as told by Water </i>is the real McCoy, vivid and important, full of urgent news about living on earth."--Thomas McGuane|ords, David James Duncan was "struck by a boyhood suspicion that rivers and mountains are myself turned inside out.

They have relied on their superior technology to do so, yet these technologies have not always guaranteed success. <i>Power over Peoples</i> examines Western imperialism's complex relationship with technology, from the first Portuguese ships that ventured down the coast of Africa in the 1430s to America's conflicts in the Middle East today.</p><br><p> Why did the sailing vessels that gave the Portuguese a century-long advantage in the Indian Ocean fail to overcome Muslim galleys in the Red Sea? Why were the same weapons and methods that the Spanish used to conquer Mexico and Peru ineffective in Chile and Africa? Why didn't America's overwhelming air power assure success in Iraq and Afghanistan? In <i>Power over Peoples</i>, Daniel Headrick traces the evolution of Western technologies--from muskets and galleons to jet planes and smart bombs--and sheds light on the environmental and social factors that have brought victory in some cases and unforeseen defeat in others. He shows how superior technology translates into greater power over nature and sometimes even other peoples, yet how technological superiority is no guarantee of success in imperialist ventures--because the technology only delivers results in a specific environment, or because the society being attacked responds in unexpected ways.</p><br><p> Breathtaking in scope, <i>Power over Peoples</i> is a revealing history of technological innovation, its promise and limitations, and its central role in the rise and fall of empire.</p></p><p><p>"This is a major contribution to historical studies, as well as the study of technological change and economic history.

Inquiry is both a way to teach and a way for students to investigate the world. Doing inquiry means asking simple but thoughtful questions about the world and engaging students to answer them. Inquiry incorporates the use of hands-on and process-oriented activities for the benefit of knowledge construction. Inquiry encourages students to connect their prior knowledge to observations and to use their observations as evidence to increase personal scientific knowledge. In this instructional environment, teachers act as facilitators of learning rather than "bankers" who have stored knowledge that they transfer into students' heads. New to the Fifth Edition </p><p> Prodigious efforts of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the National Research Council, and other groups in the 1990s have provided a coherent vision and a research-based framework for a new era of science education. As a result, the National Science Education Standards (NSES) were created to coordinate the goals and objectives for science instruction. The National Science Education Standards provide directives not only for the setting up of district-wide science programs but also for the science concepts that are to be covered in inquiry activities at each grade level. These standards are not rigid but rather provide you, and the school system in which you teach, concrete guidelines for exposing students to science experiences throughout their schooling. As you become familiar with the National Science Education Standards you will be able to incorporate the activities provided in this text into your lesson plans and curricular goals for your school science program. </p><p> Significant changes within this edition include:</p><p>Practical suggestions for building learning communities include guidelines for the development of cooperative group strategies. Members of cooperative groups encourage the exchange of ideas among students during inquiry experiences. Instructional models for continuing professional development are illustrated in Video Case Studies. Nine elementary and middle school teachers reflect on their growth as science teachers as they work with science mentors and explore how they could teach science better. The Companion Website identifies how to utilize technology while learning how to teach science effectively. The Video Case Studies </p><p> Your professor will have copies of several exemplary Video Case Studies. These cases illustrate the professional development of classroom teachers in their search to become more effective at teaching science. When reviewing the Video Case Studies, it is important to explain how to get the most out of using them to advance your own learning. </p><p> The Value of Video Cases. In their practical guide Designing Professional Development for Teachers of Science and Mathematics, Susan Loucks-Horsley, Peter Hewson, Nancy Love, and Katherine Stiles (1998) identified the case study method as one of the most important strategies for professional development. The process of observing and reflecting on teachers' actions, and on students' learning and thinking, can lead to changes in the knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and ultimately the practice of pre-service and in-service teachers. You and your colleagues can use classroom discussions about the Video Case Studies to:</p><p>extend and apply knowledge presented in the chapters, formulate questions and ideas, learn from one another, become aware of alternative perspectives and strategies, reflect on real problems faced by practicing teachers, and increase your science knowledge, as more than 30 science topics are taught in the case studies. </p><p> The Annenberg Case Studies. The Video Case Studies are available free to your professor, and are part of the professional library developed by Annenberg. In the cases chosen to accompany your study of this text, ten video cases depict nine different teachers in three videos in Annenberg's Case Studies in Science Education series. Each video case is divided into three segments: An Introduction to the Case, Trying New Ideas, and Reflecting and Building on Change. The three parts of each Video Case Study enable you to look in on a teacher and his or her students at intervals throughout the school year. From one segment to the next, in each case you will see how the teacher undergoes professional changes in approaching science teaching. The changes reflect the real life experiences of teachers who see a need to improve the way they teach, meet with a teaching mentor to gather ideas, and implement ways to improve their science teaching practice. As a result of this work you will witness not only a teacher's growing confidence and capability in science teaching but also a growing involvement of students in their own science learning. </p><p> For optimum benefit while watching the video segments, you as a participant have an opportunity to "share a commitment to improve your teaching practice, a willingness to share and critically discuss aspects of practice and curiosity about important assumptions that underlie teaching and learning" (Loucks-Horsley et al., 1998, pp. 108-109). A knowledgeable and experienced facilitator can enhance the case discussions. The role of the facilitator is to help participants</p><p>understand the situation and issues in the case, focus on the thinking of students in the video classrooms, examine the approach taken by the teacher, reflect on the theoretical foundation for the teachers' actions, and consider alternative actions and their consequences (Loucks-Horsley et al., 1998). </p><p> Although these Video Case Studies are not intended to replace actual classroom visits, they can provide a more focused picture of specific aspects of teaching and learning than might be obtained from real-time observations of classes. The Companion Website </p><p> A Companion Website designed for student and professor use accompanies this text. The Syllabus Manager allows professors the opportunity to place the class syllabus online. This enables students to also see a course calendar, chapter assignments and course changes as they are posted. In addition, content information is organized as chapter-by-chapter features and provides you with study guide questions and self-assessment tests so you can check your own understanding of teaching science in an ongoing way. Links on the website navigation bar can transport you to</p><p>focus questions you can use as a study guide, online quizzes that are self-pacing and self-evaluating, with scores e-mailed to professors if desired, Web destinations and links to wonderful science resources on the Internet, and a Message Board where you can engage in meaningful discourse about science teaching and learning issues with others taking the course. </p><p> Unique to this Companion Website are virtual classroom experiences. Although they are linked more directly to the ninth edition of the core text, Teaching Science as Inquiry, the video essays depicted in certain Website chapters will let you see how well you understand the components of good science teaching. Videostreaming on the video essays illustrates the various teaching strategies of classroom teachers teaching properties of air in grade 1, balance beams in grade 4, and pendulums in grade 8. As you begin to understand the components of good science instruction, test yourself on the strategies that exemplify effective science teaching. You should also see opportunities for improving each science lesson. As you become more familiar with the rudiments of effective science instruction, you 'nay choose to revisit these virtual sites and reassess your understanding of science teaching and learning.

In "Home," Nobel laureate Toni Morrison muses on her uses of African American speech and the question of "how to be free and situated; how to convert a racist house into a race specific yet nonracist house." Harvard professor Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham's "Rethinking Vernacular Culture" details the affirmative role of Afro-American religion and blues-oriented race records of the 1920s and 1930s. Williams College's David Lionel Smith, in "What Is Black Culture?", gives a well-nuanced critique of the contradictory and limiting definitions of "blackness," while activist-educator Angela Y. Davis's "Race and Criminality" shows how blacks have become a racially criminalized commodity in America's rapidly expanding prison industry. <i>The House That Race Built</i> is a strong, intelligent weapon against racism. <i>--Eugene Holley, Jr.</i>Essays contributed by Toni Morrison and others who attended the Race Matters Conference at Princeton University provide powerful insights into racism and democracy.

A full description of the &#39;binocular sky&#39; is given, with details of all the most interesting objects. On a clear dark night, with a myriad stars shining down, the jewelled beauty and the unimaginable immensity of our universe is awe-inspiring. Some people make the investment that is required to buy a telescope, but for many others, stargazing through binoculars can be just as rewarding and may lead to a deep interest and lifelong hobby! Patrick Moore has painstakingly researched this book to cater for such people. He carefully explains the rudiments of astronomy and the selection of suitable binoculars before discussing in more detail the array of beautiful astronomical objects that await the binocular observer - stars, clusters, nebulae and galaxies. The night sky that is seen by observers in both northern and southern hemispheres is charted season by season before a detailed presentation is made, with maps, of all the constellations. The use of binoculars for observing the sun, the Moon, the planets, comets and shooting stars is then described. The illustrations throughout have been prepared by the artist Paul Doherty working in close collaboration with the author.</p><p>On a starry night, the beauty and immensity of our universe is awe-inspiring.

Part of a group of artists working in New York in the 1980s that included Jack Goldstein, Sherrie Levine, Richard Prince, Cindy Sherman and Laurie Simmons, Charlesworth straddled 1970s Conceptual art and the Pictures Generation, creating work that probed the visual language of mass media and illuminated the impact of ubiquitous imagery on our everyday lives.<br><br>This fully illustrated catalogue accompanying Charlesworth's first major survey in New York features series such as <i>Stills</i> (1980), a group of 14 large-scale works rephotographed from press images that depict people falling or jumping off buildings; <i>Modern History</i> (1977-79), which pioneered photographic appropriation; the alluring <i>Objects of Desire</i> (1983-88) and <i>Renaissance Paintings</i> (1991), which continued Charlesworth's trenchant approach to mining the language of photography; <i>Doubleworld</i> (1995), which probes the fetishism of vision in pre-modernist art and marks Charlesworth's transition to a more active role behind the camera; and her final series, <i>Available Light</i> (2012).<br><br><b>Sarah Charlesworth</b> was born in 1947 in East Orange, New Jersey, and received a BA from Barnard College in 1969. She was the subject of a 1997 retrospective organized by SITE Santa Fe. Charlesworth taught photography for many years at the School of the Visual Arts, New York; the Rhode Island School of Design, Providence; and Princeton University, New Jersey. She died in 2013 in Falls Village, Connecticut.</p><p>By removing images from their original context and placing them in an alternative space, Charlesworth is in essence creating a new language....we might call Charlesworth not a &#x201c;Writer&#x201d; but instead an &#x201c;un-writer&#x201d; who un-wrote: removing, redacting, and then showing us our world anew, through her eyes, in her Doubleworld. (Cynthia Cruz <i>Hyperallergic</i>)<br><br>The world Sarah Charlesworth depicts is not simply a duplication of the world we know, but a separate world that insists upon the infinite complexity&#x2015;and power&#x2015;of pictures. (Simone Krug <i>Brooklyn Rail</i>)<br><br>Of all the Pictures artists, many of whom were women, few remained as stauncly loyal to photography as she. No one explored its history, formal possibilities and very mechanisms with such a determined, even obsessive, drive, nor did anyone make color so abstract and implacable.

This book offers some of the latest research in terrorism studies. The contributors examine the sources of contemporary terrorism, discussing the impact of globalization, the influence of religious beliefs, and the increasing dissatisfaction felt by the world's powerless. They consider the strategies and motivations of terrorists, offering contending perspectives on whether or not terrorists can be said to achieve their goals; explore different responses to the threat of terrorism, discussing such topics as how the United States can work more effectively with its allies; and contemplate the future of al-Qaida, asking if its networked structure is an asset or a liability.</p><p>The essays in <i>Contending with Terrorism</i> address some of the central topics in the analysis of contemporary terrorism.

This text offers a comprehensive development of water resource economics that is accessible to engineers and natural scientists as well as economists. The goal is to build a practical platform for understanding and performing economic analysis using both theoretical and empirical tools. The mathematics needed to understand the subjects covered in this text include basic optimization methods and integral calculus. Familiarity with microeconomics or natural resource economics is helpful, but all the economics needed is presented and developed progressively in the text. Many water-based example calculations are included. Thus the book can be used for independent study as well as course work.The book focuses on the scarcity of water quantity (rather than water quality). The author presents the economic theory of resource allocation, recognizing the peculiarities imposed by water, and expands the theory to encompass time-defined matters such as ground water depletion. He then discusses such subjects as institutional economics, water law, how economics is used in policy and cost-benefit analysis, the roles of water marketing and water pricing, demand and supply estimation, privatization, and modeling with demand and supply functions. As an aid to readers with specific interests, references to recent literature are given for all of these topics. Each chapter ends with a summary and exercises. All graphic portrayals of economic theory and most calculations are performed using Mathematica software. These programs are downloadable, but their use is entirely optional.</p></p><p><p>Ronald C. Griffin is Professor, Department of Agricultural Economics, Texas A&amp;M University.</p><p>Griffin has succeeded in producing something rare: an economics textbook that is both comprehensive in its topical coverage <i>and</i> lively enough to engage non-economists! Sound mathematical/graphical treatment of key subjects, yet easy-to-follow prose: this book ought to be required reading not only for students of water resource economics but for public officials and water agency staff worldwide. </p> (Bonnie Colby, Professor, Departments of Agricultural &amp; Resource Economics and Hydrology, University of Arizona)<br><br><p>What differentiates this book from others on water economics issues is its comprehensive overview of the subject matter, including institutional analysis, various appraoches to water efficiency, and policy analysis, to mention only a few. Griffin is uniquely placed to write such a book, and he eloquently guides the reader through the economic links between scarcity, policies, and projects in a way that accommodates differing levels of comprehension. This book is special, long awaited by economists and water professionals.</p> (Ariel Dinar, The World Bank)<br><br><p>This text provides a rigorous conceptual basis for economics while simultaneously enabling students to obtain a solid background in water resource economics in a single course. Griffin uses a minimum of mathematics and economics jargon to explain economic concepts applied to water resource planning problems. His book makes a fundamental contribution to multidisciplinary curricula in water resource engineering, planning, and management, and should be required reading for all students in such programs.</p> (Richard M. Vogel, Professor of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Tufts University)<br><br><p>Griffin's wonderful text provides balanced and insightful coverage of the economics and management of water resources. He guides the reader through the fascinating world of water institutions, using economic theory to shed light on private choices, market outcomes, and policy design. The book can be the main text for a intermediate course in water economics or even natural resources.

Lewis analyzes social conventions as regularities in the resolution of recurring coordination problems-situations characterized by interdependent decision processes in which common interests are at stake. Conventions are contrasted with other kinds of regularity, and conventions governing systems of communication are given special attention.</p></p><p><b><br> </b> <p><b>David Lewis</b> (1941&#x2013;2001) was Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University. His publications include <i>Counterfactuals</i> (reissued by Blackwell 2000), <i>On the Plurality of Worlds</i> (reissued by Blackwell, 2000), <i>Parts of Classes</i> (1991), and numerous articles in metaphysics and other areas. Many of his writings are available in his <i>Collected Papers</i>.</p>"This book is my attempt at an analysis of our common, established concept of convention, so that you will recognize that it explains what you must have in mind when you say that language is governed by conventions. Language is only one among many activities governed by conventions that we did not create by agreeing and that we cannot describe." <i>David Lewis</i><br> <p>"Readers will be indebted to the author of this book." <i>Philosophical Quarterly</i><br> </p> <p>"The notion of convention has served philosophers since Aristotle as a convenient exploration of the arbitrary character of referential word meaning. In 1936 Willard Quine, pursuing the notion of analyticity, called attention to the emptiness of this explanation. David Lewis has attempted to re-establish the notion of convention as a partial explanation of analytic truth [and his] explication of "convention" is a <i>tour de force</i> of Humean analysis." <i>Philosophy and Rhetoric</i><br> </p> <p>"This book has been published for quite some time. Its significant contribution is no longer in question [and it will] remain a central reference for discussions on the nature of conventions.

A literary dialogue in the Greek tradition, it was written in 55 BCE in the midst of political turmoil at Rome, but reports a discussion &#39;concerning the (ideal) orator&#39; that supposedly took place in 90 BCE, just before an earlier crisis. Cicero features eminent orators and statesmen of the past as participants in this discussion, presenting competing views on many topics. This edition of Book III is the first since 1893 to provide a Latin text and full introduction and commentary in English. It is intended to help advanced students and others interested in Roman literature to comprehend the grammar and appreciate the stylistic nuances of Cicero&#39;s Latin, to trace the historical, literary, and theoretical background of the topics addressed, and to interpret Book III in relation to the rest of De Oratore and to Cicero&#39;s other works.</p><p>The first English commentary on De Oratore in more than a century, examining Book III in depth. This important and influential text deals with the relationship between oratorical style and content, with Cicero expressing his views on the training and qualification of the ideal orator-statesman.David Mankin is Associate Professor of Classics at Cornell University, New York, where he teaches Latin language and literature, Greek epic and mythology, and Roman civilization.

In a career spanning thirty-five years and forty books, he has challenged and provoked us with writing that is decidedly unafraid of the tensions between ordinary and poetic language, and between everyday life and its adversaries. <i>Attack of the Difficult Poems</i>, his latest collection of essays, gathers some of his most memorably irreverent work while addressing seriously and comprehensively the state of contemporary humanities, the teaching of unconventional forms, fresh approaches to translation, the history of language media, and the connections between poetry and visual art.</p> <p>Applying an array of essayistic styles, <i>Attack of the Difficult Poems</i> ardently engages with the promise of its title. Bernstein introduces his key theme of the difficulty of poems and defends, often in comedic ways, not just difficult poetry but poetry itself. Bernstein never loses his ingenious ability to argue or his consummate attention to detail. Along the way, he offers a wide-ranging critique of literature&#x2019;s place in the academy, taking on the vexed role of innovation and approaching it from the perspective of both teacher and practitioner.</p> <p>From blues artists to Tin Pan Alley song lyricists to Second Wave modernist poets, <i>The Attack of the Difficult Poems</i> sounds both a battle cry and a lament for the task of the language maker and the fate of invention.</p></p><p><p><b>Charles Bernstein </b>is the Donald T.

Though "no company the authors know of is on a truly long-term sustainable course," Esty and Winston label the forward-thinking, green-friendly (or at least green-acquainted) companies WaveMakers and set out to assess honestly their path toward environmental responsibility, and its impact on a company's bottom line, customers, suppliers and reputation. Following the evolution of business attitudes toward environmental concerns, Esty and Winston offer a series of fascinating plays by corporations such as Wal-Mart, GE and Chiquita (Banana), the bad guys who made good, and the good guys-watchdogs and industry associations, mostly-working behind the scenes. A vast number of topics huddle beneath the umbrella of threats to the earth, and many get a thorough analysis here: from global warming to electronic waste "take-back" legislation to subsidizing sustainable seafood.

Returning to Greece after German exile, following his part in the abortive uprising against the occupying Turks (1770), and his failure as both a lover and a revolutionary, Hyperion assumes a hermitic existence, during which he writes his letters. Confronting and commenting on his own past, with all its joy and grief, the narrator undergoes a transformation that culminates in the realisation of his true vocation.</p><p>Though H�lderlin is now established as a great lyric poet, recognition of his novel as a supreme achievement of European Romanticism has been belated in the Anglophone world. Incorporating the aesthetic evangelism that is a characteristic feature of the age, <em>Hyperion </em>preaches a message of redemption through beauty. The resolution of the contradictions and antinomies raised in the novel is found in the act of articulation itself. To a degree remarkable in a prose work of any length, what it means is inseparable from how it means. In this skilful translation, Gaskill conveys the beautiful music and rhythms of H�lderlin&#x2019;s language to an English-speaking reader.</p></p><p>Howard Gaskill is an Honorary Fellow in German at the University of Edinburgh, where he taught for 32 years, retiring as Reader in 2001. His main research interests have focused on German literature of the Goethe period (in particular H�lderlin); Scottish-German literary relations (in particular Ossianism); &#39;Ossian&#39;-Macpherson and his European impact; literary translation.<p><em>H�lderlin's only novel, Hyperion, is still not widely enough known in the English-speaking world despite its unquestionable importance. Now its moment has come in a new translation by Howard Gaskill, who probably knows the book better than anyone else alive. His version is the fruit of long years of loving attention, and it catches much of the beauty and texture of the original&#x2014;its rhythms, diction, variety and shifts of style. </em></p><p><em>&#x2014;</em>Prof. Charlie Louth, University of Oxford</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>This is a superb version of </em><em><em>H�lderlin</em>'s novel: accurate, elegant and inspiring. It will at long last bring this major text of German literature within the reach of the Anglophone public. Although </em><em><em>H�lderlin</em> is acclaimed as a poet among English-speaking readers and is also known as a philosopher, his achievement as a novelist has hitherto remained unrecognised. Gaskill will remedy this and henceforth this great novel will be read by students of European Romanticism and all lovers of </em><em><em>H�lderlin</em>'s work.</em></p><p><em>&#x2014;</em>Prof. Jeremy D.

At least four great themes - Renaissance, Reformation, Counter-Reformation and Expansion - vie for dominance. The decisive cultural theme of the fifteenth century - classical revival in Italy - had spread and diversified, the social structures of the Ancien Regime were yet to solidify. This study examines the symptons of expansion - population growth, adventure overseas, new voyages of the imagination - and the areas of conflict - the world and the spirit, the public and private spheres, elite and popular cultures - and argues that spiritual quest and intellectual curiosity had the same cultural roots.</p><p>&#39;...an impressively comprehensive survey...Fast-moving, stylish, and witty...an enjoyable book.&#39; - Mary Laven, International History Review</p><h2>Beginning Russian</h2><p>This improved one-volume edition of a very successful textbook contains just about the same vocabulary and introduces grammatical features in about the same order as the first edition. In other respects the book has been severely revised and reformatted. It has been shortened, so that it is truly a first-year textbook, one that can successfully be completed within two semesters, but still contains a discussion of all major grammatical categories of Russian. The original large lessons have been broken up into units that correspond to a day&#39;s work; there are 110 lessons, plus 14 grammar reviews. The reading selections (the Zyuzya story) of the first edition have been eliminated. There is much more information and exercise material on pronunciation and intonation. As in the first edition, many of the exercises are in the form of short conversations; this provides a kind of bridge between strict grammar drill and totally free conversation.

What makes some relationships work so smoothly and others burst into flames? Sternberg gives us new answers to these questions by showing that the kind of relationship we create depends on the kind of love stories we carry inside us. Drawing on extensive research and fascinating examples of real couples, Sternberg identifies 26 types of love story--including the fantasy story, the business story, the collector story, the horror story, and many others--each with its distinctive advantages and pitfalls, and many of which are clashingly incompatible. These are the largely unconscious preconceptions that guide our romantic choices, and it is only by becoming aware of the kind of story we have about love that we gain the freedom to create more fulfilling and lasting relationships. As long as we remain oblivious to the role our stories play, we are likely to repeat the same mistakes again and again. But the enlivening good news this book brings us is that though our stories drive us, we can revise them and learn to choose partners whose stories are more compatible with our own.<br> Quizzes in each chapter help you to see which stories you identify with most strongly and which apply to your partner. Are you a traveler, a gardener, a teacher, or something else entirely? <em>Love is a Story</em> shows you how to find out.<br></p><p>We've all seen them: that annoying couple that is always bickering, always arguing, always seeming to be on the verge of a breakup (think Ethel and Fred Mertz), yet somehow, keeps the relationship going, actually staying married till death do them part. And then there's the couple that's simply <i>perfect</i> for each other. Maybe he was the captain of the football team and she was the prom queen. They finish each other's sentences. They habitually exhibit public displays of affection. Somehow, though, they're unable to keep it together and end up splitting up, frequently not even sure themselves why it happened. How do these things happen? What is it that determines which relationships will work and which are destined to fail? Robert J. Sternberg, a professor of psychology at Yale University and author of <i>Successful Intelligence</i>, has developed the theory of a "love story" to help explain how relationships function, which he explores in his groundbreaking book, <i>Love Is a Story</i>.<p> Sternberg purports that each one of us creates a love story for ourselves. These stories are created unconsciously and usually at a fairly young age. When we get older, Sternberg tells us, our relationships are dictated by the kind of stories we have created, often causing difficulty when our partner's stories are incompatible with our own. In his illuminating work, Sternberg first briefly explains where our stories come from and how we formulate them. Then, in the bulk of the text, he identifies 26 different kinds of love stories, giving two case studies for each one. The types range from the war story to the house and home story to the science-fiction story. The positive and negative attributes for each are given, plus a small questionnaire to determine if you fall into a particular pattern. The last section of the book examines the implications of what you've learned.</p><p> Sternberg has some interesting points in his book--and certainly learning what kind of unconscious love patterns you hold onto is helpful--but at times the view seems rather bleak. All of the stories seem to have significant downsides to them, perhaps making the reader reluctant to identify with any particular group. Also, as you are sure to be more multidimensional than the rather flat characters in the case studies, you are likely to fall into more than one group, which, Sternberg permits, is a possibility, but it makes it more difficult to attack the problems at hand. His book, however, is a unique study presenting new ideas that make a lot of sense and could explain your relationship trends. <i>Love Is a Story</i> just may give you valuable insight into why your relationships may or may not be working and give you the knowledge you need to help you find the right person. <i>--Jenny Brown</i></p><br><strong>Robert J.

Herzog's <em>Father Hunger: Explorations with Adults and Children</em> will quickly take its place both as a landmark contribution to developmental psychology and as an enduring classic in the clinical literature of psychoanalysis.&nbsp; We live in an era when a great many children grow up without a father, or, worse still, with fathers who traumatically abuse them.&nbsp; Yet, society continues to ignore the emotional price that children pay, and often continue to pay throughout their lives, for this tragic state of affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Father Hunger</em> will change this situation.&nbsp; First drawn to his topic by observing the recurring nightmares of clinic-referred children of newly separated parents - nightmares in which the children's fear of their own aggression was coupled with desperate wishes for their fathers' return - Herzog went on to spend more than two decades exploring the role of the father in a variety of naturalistic settings.&nbsp; He discovered that the characteristically intense manner in which fathers engaged their children provided an experience of contained excitement that served as a necessary scaffolding to the children's emerging sense of self and as a potential buffer against future trauma.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>A brilliant observer and remarkably gifted, caring clinician, Herzog remains true to the ambiguities and multiple leves of meaning that arise in therapeutic encounters with real people.&nbsp; He consistently locates his therapeutic strategies and clinical discoveries within a sophisticated observational framework, thus making his formulations about father hunger and its remediation of immediate value to scientific researchers.&nbsp; A model of humane psychoanalytic exploration in response to a deepening social problem, <em>Father Hunger</em> is a clinical document destined to raise public consciousness and help shape social policy.&nbsp; And in the extraordinary stories of therapeutic struggle and restoration that emerge from its pages, it is a stunning testament to the resiliency of the human spirit.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p>James M. Herzog, M.D., is an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and an adjunct professor of psychiatry at the University of Hamburg, Germany.&nbsp; He is an adult training and supervising analyst and a child and adolescent supervisory analyst at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute.&nbsp; He is also a supervisory analyst at the Sigmund Freud Institute in Zurich, Switzerland.&nbsp;Riveting page turners are more the exception than the rule in psychoanalytic explorations, and James Herzog has written a fine one in his Father Hunger. Right from the preface, we know that this will be a passionate and revelatory book about the "other" crucial human intimate in the child's universe, as seen through the eye, ear, mind, and heart of an able clinician. He sets himself the following task: "to accompany, even in terror; to refuse to extract myself, even at a cost; and to try to help so that a person who requests my assistance, and with whom I have forged an alliance, need not do it alone." Such forceful language, it seems, is well suited to the rigorous exploration of the complex internal domain of children's longings and appetites for their fathers. Dr. Herzog knows well that he will have to make his case regarding the universal relevance of the father to healthy child development from a variety of perspectives. Like a disciplined surveyor suspicious of his measurements, he skillfully fixes his, and subsequently our, understanding of father hunger in time and space from several vantage points: the analytic couch and environs, the medical consulting room (with 103 men who fathered premature infants), the community consulting room (where 40 teenage boys spent 30 weeks participating in small-group discussions of sexuality and intimacy), and the wider perspective of clinical-research settings. Comfortable and literate in these diverse cultures, the author argues a series of theses throughout the book: all children need their fathers, a thesis that is supported by the majority of clinical evidence (despite the relative frequency with which that need remains unmet); fathers are indispensable in helping children manage their separation from their mothers and their autonomy, as well as their aggressive drives and fantasies; much can be learned about father-child transactions through the study of trauma and repair, play, and intrapsychic development; fatherhood is inexorably related to the conjugal relationship; the meaning of prospective fatherhood is assimilated into the individual man's life history to a greater degree than the meaning of prospective motherhood is for individual women; and finally -- Herzog's most creative and provocative contribution -- all men (and boys) need to participate in relationships with a male parent who is himself loved by a female parent. The author actively engages the reader's curiosity and knowledge base with the authenticity and compassion of his own clinical work. One is struck and moved from the outset by the high, nonjudgmental regard in which Herzog holds his coinvestigating adult and child patients and their families. By implication and example, he reiterates that the way one is as an analyst is at least as important as what one does as an analyst. I was reminded frequently of Jeree Pawl's admonition to "do unto others as you would have others do unto others." Were the analytic presence considered in terms of optimal dosage, Herzog's touch could serve as a useful standard. In his use of an analytic vocabulary, Herzog is respectful of his broader readership, relying only rarely on guild language. Even then, as in his discussion of the "caretaking line of development in boys and men," he widens the clinical application of the theoretical concept so that it may be easily understood and integrated into the next level of discussion. His ideas, in fact, seem to him to require more than one language in order to be understood, and he uses Romance languages and poetic references throughout the book to freshen the eye, mind, and palate. This touch is aesthetically pleasing without diminishing the warmth, humor, and accessibility of Dr. Herzog's narrative. He is equally circumspect in his use of clinical concepts and new language. Much analytic writing may be justly criticized for relying on an idiosyncratic use of language, but Herzog is wisely sparing in his dependence on esoterica. Corroboration of Herzog's theses is interwoven with other contemporary scholarship on fatherhood and child development. In Chapter 15 ("Expectant Fatherhood"), he organizes his observations of paternal behavior into various stages, from getting ready through conception, the turn toward father and fathering, and delivery. The mosaic of mood and behavioral changes, in which fantasies are nurtured and aggression is avoided, was recently validated in two Canadian investigations that tracked hormonal changes in men during the period when they are anticipating fatherhood. An increase in estrogen and prolactin levels and a reduction in the level of circulating testosterone may be the biologic mediators of the psychological experience Herzog describes. Further corroboration of his clinical observations regarding father hunger in boys whose parents are divorcing is also accumulating in the prospective Collaborative Divorce Project in Connecticut that is investigating developmental sequelae in 160 families with divorcing parents and children under six years of age. The project's methodology calls for multiple empirical investigations of the children and their families, including play interviews with experienced clinicians to inquire into the child's experience of and imaginings about divorce. Sleep difficulties and troubled dreams are frequently reported in the preschool children as their time with their father diminishes. One closes this book reluctantly, feeling inspired, challenged, and enriched by its unflinching exploration of the domain of the father's relationship with his child in the presence of the mother. We are inspired to listen more carefully to our patients, challenged to risk more of ourselves on their behalf in order to understand this unique appetite, and enriched by the time spent with this creative clinician who understands the internal experiences of children and the relationships that humanize them so incredibly well. <i>Kyle D.

It will be something nobody has ever done before.&#39; The title page of the first complete English translation of Against Nature (published in the French as � Rebours) included the caption &#39;the book that Dorian Gray loved and inspired Oscar Wilde.&#39; It was, declared Wilde, one of the best novels he had ever read. It is the story of Jean des Esseintes, the last of a proud and noble family, who retreats from the world in disgust at bourgeois society and leads a life based on cultivation of the senses through art. Des Esseintes distills perfumes from the rarest oils and essences, he creates a garden of poisonous flowers, sets gemstones in a tortoise&#39;s gold-painted shell and plans to corrupt a street urchin until he is degraded enough to commit murder. Des Esseintes&#39; aesthetic pilgrimage is described in minutely documented realistic detail and was widely regarded as the guidebook of decadence.

But what were and are the true potentates of our planet? Insects, says Scott Richard Shaw&#x2015;<i>millions</i> and <i>millions</i> of insect species. Starting in the shallow oceans of ancient Earth and ending in the far reaches of outer space&#x2015;where, Shaw proposes, insect-like aliens may have achieved similar preeminence&#x2015;<i>Planet of the Bugs</i> spins a sweeping account of insects&#x2019; evolution from humble arthropod ancestors into the bugs we know and love (or fear and hate) today.<br><br> Leaving no stone unturned, Shaw explores how evolutionary innovations such as small body size, wings, metamorphosis, and parasitic behavior have enabled insects to disperse widely, occupy increasingly narrow niches, and survive global catastrophes in their rise to dominance. Through buggy tales by turns bizarre and comical&#x2015;from caddisflies that construct portable houses or weave silken aquatic nets to trap floating debris, to parasitic wasp larvae that develop in the blood of host insects and, by storing waste products in their rear ends, are able to postpone defecation until after they emerge&#x2015;he not only unearths how changes in our planet&#x2019;s geology, flora, and fauna contributed to insects&#x2019; success, but also how, in return, insects came to shape terrestrial ecosystems and amplify biodiversity. Indeed, in his visits to hyperdiverse rain forests to highlight the current insect extinction crisis, Shaw reaffirms just how crucial these tiny beings are to planetary health and human survival.<br><br> In this age of honeybee die-offs and bedbugs hitching rides in the spines of library books, <i>Planet of the Bugs </i>charms with humor, affection, and insight into the world&#x2019;s six-legged creatures, revealing an essential importance that resonates across time and space.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Scott Richard Shaw</b> is professor of entomology and Insect Museum curator at the University of Wyoming, Laramie. He has discovered more than one hundred and fifty insect species, including a number of parasitic wasps named after cultural icons such as David Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Ellen DeGeneres, and Shakira&#x2014;the last of which, <i>Aleiodes shakirae</i>, causes its host caterpillar to contort as if belly dancing.&#x201c;[One of] the best popular science books of 2014: biological sciences.&#x201d; (GrrlScientist <i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This succinct but vivid history of the planet is told from the perspective of insects, which have dominated the terrestrial environment for millions of&nbsp;years. It is a humbling perspective, one that puts us well and truly in our place&#x2014;principally as the destroyers of a natural environment that insects have been helping to preserve long before our&nbsp;ancestors crawled out of the primal slime. . . . Shaw writes with a contagious enthusiasm and is an excellent guide to the history of our buggy planet.&#x201d; (PD Smith <i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>"Shaw&#x2019;s detailed investigation places the broad classifications of ancient and modern insects in the context of their development, and, by showing specifics of coevolution, he makes a strong case for valuing the interconnectedness of all life." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Shaw tackles evolution from the perspective of the insects, a refreshing and insightful change from the usual human-centered view, and argues convincingly that insects have diversified and thrived more successfully than any other animal on Earth. . . . Shaw's coherent, precise writing is complemented by pleasing illustrations of insects and fossils. . . . A readable, compact introduction for the layperson.&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The 165-million-year-long era when dinosaurs roamed the Earth shouldn&#x2019;t be called the Age of Reptiles. Nor should the era that followed, which extends to the present, be christened the Age of Mammals. Just ask an insect guy. In <i>Planet of the Bugs</i>, Shaw . . . makes a good case that Earth has long been dominated by insects. . . . In a chapter-by-chapter march through time, [he] engagingly chronicles the evolutionary innovations that have rendered insects so successful. . . . Drawing from field studies and the fossil record, <i>Planet of the Bugs</i> is a fascinating look at the rise and proliferation of creatures that shape ecosystems worldwide.&#x201d; (Sid Perkins <i>Science News</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Behind the witty prose lies a serious message. The triumph of insects is inseparably connected to the success and progression of almost all life on the planet in some way or another. Insects have coevolved with plants and animals and can act as friend or foe, spanning all lifestyles from predator to parasite to pollinator. So entangled are they in the fate of many cornerstone species that the decline of insect groups has put many ecosystems at risk of collapse, including several that are crucial for human survival. We may be somewhat flippant about their influence on our own evolutionary history, but we can be sure that the demise of insects would have catastrophic consequences for our future. . . . Eloquent and very knowledgeable, Shaw is also, perhaps more importantly when it comes to a good read, a storyteller capable of painting a rich portrayal of prehistoric lands filled with weird and wonderful bugs and beasts. His captivating and comical writing had me marveling at detailed accounts of giant dragonfly-like beasts with two-foot wingspans, and laughing out loud at aptly named sections such as &#x2018;Secretive societies with an anal fixation.&#x2019; I am not, it is fair to say, a lover of things that creep and crawl, but looking through Shaw&#x2019;s eyes, I found myself appreciating their place in my world a little more. Moreover, as he made me realize, it is not my world at all, but theirs.&#x201d; (Tiffany Taylor, University of Reading <i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Accessible and entertaining . . . . Shaw&#x2019;s unusual perspective on life can be delightfully askew: why, he asks, do we give our loved ones flowers instead of stink bugs, when many of the latter are just as colourful and sweet-smelling? Overall, readers should come away with a deeper appreciation of insect diversity, and a fresh regard for evolution&#x2019;s sweep.&#x201d; (Bob Holmes <i>New Scientist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Shaw has been collecting bugs since he was four. Now a professor of entomology at the University of Wyoming, he shares his passion for these creatures and their cosmological significance in <i>Planet of the Bugs</i>. The scope of this work is immense. . . . Packed with intriguing trivia. . . . Shaw boggles the reader with his enthusiasm and expertise, and reveals a playful side. Among his many encyclopedic turns, he waxes philosophical and indulges in metaphor and even humor, resulting in a surprisingly accessible and entertaining read. A love of bugs is not required. Discover: An impassioned view of insect evolution and the awesome implications of bugs for all life on earth.&#x201d; (Julia Jenkins <i>Shelf Awareness for Readers</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Shaw is a masterful guide to insects&#x2019; intimidating diversity and complicated history. . . . He is particularly effective at dispelling misconceptions, pointing out that, despite what exterminators might suggest, most insects are not pests. . . . Science-minded readers will appreciate how alternative, competing hypotheses are presented for various unresolved questions, like why insects first evolved flight and the causes of mass extinctions. In the end, <i>Planet of the Bugs</i> succeeds as an accessible introduction to the evolutionary history of the organisms that truly dominate our planet. (Hint: It&#x2019;s not us.).&#x201d; (Scott Solomon, Rice University <i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Shaw does a wonderful job of describing how important insects are by giving a chronological account of their terrifically successful and diverse evolution. . . . Humorous and provocative. . . . The insects are more numerous, more speciated, more diverse, and historically more influential than we, and despite all the detrimental changes we have wrought especially over the past couple of centuries, it is the insects&#x2019; planet, and my bet is that it will remain so even if the humans don&#x2019;t last on it.&#x201d; (Rob Hardy <i>Commercial Dispatch</i>)</p><h2>Gandhi on Non-Violence (New Directions Paperbook)</h2><p><p><strong>An essential compendium for understanding Gandhi's profound legacy.</strong></p><em>"One has to speak out and stand up for one's convictions.

The first part contains relevant data about SPICE in order to analyze both linear passive and electronic circuits. The latter half provides more detail on such topics as distortion models and analysis, basic algorithms in SPICE, analysis option parameters and how to direct SPICE to find a solution when it fails.</p><p>This new book, written by Andre Vladimirescu, who was instrumental in the development of SPICE at the University of California Berkeley, introduces computer simulation of electrical and electronics circuits based on the SPICE standard. Relying on the functionality first supported in SPICE2 that is now supported in all SPICE programs, this text is addressed to all users of electrical simulation. The approach to learning circuit simulation is to interpret simulation results in relation to electrical engineering fundamentals; the book asks the student to solve most circuit examples by hand before verifying the results with SPICE. Addressed to both the SPICE novice and the experienced user, the first six chapters provide the relevant information on SPICE functionality for the analysis of linear as well as nonlinear circuits. Each of these chapters starts out with a linear example accessible to any new user of SPICE and proceeds with nonlinear transistor circuits. The latter part of the book goes into more detail on such issues as functional and hierarchical models, distortion analysis, basic algorithms in SPICE and related options parameters, and, how to direct SPICE to find a solution when it does not converge to a solution. The approach emphasizes that SPICE is not a substitute for knowledge of circuit operation but a complement. The SPICE Book is different from previously published books in the approach of solving circuit problems with a computer. The solution to most circuit examples is sketched out by hand first and followed by a SPICE verification. For more complex circuits it is not feasible to find the solution by hand but the approach stresses the need for the SPICE user tounderstand the results. Readers gain a better comprehension of SPICE thanks to the importance placed on the relation between EE fundamentals and computer simulation. The tutorial approach advances from the hand solution of a circuit to SPICE verification and simulation results interpretation. This book teaches the approach to electrical circuit simulation rather than a specific simulation program. Examples are simulated alternatively with SPICE2, SPICE3 or PSPICE. Accurate descriptions, simulation rationale and cogent explanations make this an invaluable reference.Andrei Vladimirescu was a key contributor to the SPICE simulator at the University of California, Berkeley. He pioneered electrical simulation on parallel computers with the CLASSIE simulator as part of his PhD and authored "The SPICE Book" published by J. Wiley and Sons. <br><br>Currently he is Professor involved in research projects at the University of California at Berkeley, Technical University of Delft and the Institute of Electronics of Paris, ISEP, as well as consultant to industry. His research activities are in the areas of design, simulation and modeling of CMOS and beyond-CMOS circuits and circuits for quantum computing.

Drawing on a vast reservoir of historical knowledge, Vidal-Naquet unravels a series of myths and ideologies that have become entangled with Jewish history over the centuries. The Jews covers subjects as deep in the past as the Jewish encounter with Hellenization in the second century B.C.E., and as current as modern-day Israeli-Palestinian relations.<br>The Jews opens in the classical period, looking in particular at the work of Flavius Josephus, who wrote the original account of the events at Masada. Resisting the powerful currents of ideological orthodoxy, Vidal-Naquet examines what he views as Israeli nationalist distortions of the historical and archaeological record at Masada. In the promotion of an ideal of Jewish unity in the ancient world, he contends, some have chosen to ignore evidence of pluralism, civil strife, and the power of the Diaspora experience in the Jewish past.<br>The book continues with an engaging discussion of the era of Jewish emancipation in Europe, during the French Revolution and thereafter, in which Vidal-Naquet explores the complex meanings of emancipation and assimilation. Employing previously unexamined material written by Alfred Dreyfus himself, he continues with a reevaluation of the Dreyfus affair, the episode of anti-Semitism and betrayal that shook France at the turn of the century.<br>The Jews explores books, films, and eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust, including works by Arno Mayer, Claude Lanzmann, and Primo Levi. The book looks also at a recently published wartime journal by Vidal-Naquet's father, written in the years before he was deported. Vidal-Naquet is equally concerned with the disturbing phenomenon of Holocaust denial, pointing to the question of the gas chambers as central to refuting revisionist claims.<br>The book closes with a personal account of growing up in Vichy France: integrating the tools of historiography with his own vivid memories of the war years, Vidal-Naquet recounts in moving detail the Occupation and the fateful day the Gestapo arrived at his home to take away his parents.</p><p>PIERRE VIDAL-NAQUET is the author of many books, including <i>Assassins of Memory: Essays on the Denial of the Holocaust</i> (Columbia).

Modern medicine has all but wiped out many diseases that once were common killers. Science and technology have given us countless devices that protect our bodies from injury, secure our property, and warn us of impending disaster. And modern intelligence gathering can pinpoint threats to our domestic security as they arise. So why is an epidemic of fear sweeping America?<p>The answer, according to nationally renowned health commentator Dr. Marc Siegel, is that we live in an artificially created culture of fear. From the anthrax panic to the SARS "epidemic," from "official" rumors of bioterror to Orange alerts to West Nile virus&#x2014;the media continually bombard us with breaking news of yet another super-bug, terrorist plot, or natural disaster that's about to wreak havoc. Most of the time the disasters never materialize. But even if they did, the odds that any of us would suffer harm from them is infinitesimally small&#x2014;especially when compared to the much greater risks of dying in a car accident or from coronary heart disease. </p><p>In False Alarm, Siegel identifies three major catalysts of the culture of fear&#x2014;government, the media, and big pharma.

Painters and practically every later sculptor, including Michelangelo, were deeply indebted to him. Much of later fifteenth-century painting in Florence stems from his work, and his influence extended to Venice. His heroic style created a new humanism that was a hallmark of the Renaissance.<br>Written by Dr. Charles Avery, an authority on European sculpture, this concise survey explores Donatello's life and work for the general reader, tourist, or student. It gives a balanced coverage of his sculpture in different media and in the different cities of Italy and of the political, social, and religious background against which Donatello's contribution to Renaissance sculpture should be seen.</p><p></p><h2>Defeating Cancer!: The Biological Effect of Deuterium Depletion</h2><p>This book is an account of experiments carried out using deuterium-depleted water (Dd-water) and of the human clinical trials underway in Hungary. The most astonishing discovery was that healthy cells quickly adapt to the lower deuterium concentration, whereas tumour cells are unable to do so. This, in the majority of cases, resulted in the destruction of cells, a decrease in tumour mass, or its total regression. The discovery detailed in the book reflects an inherent possibility for mankind to start the 21st century in the hope of finding the cure for cancer.</p><p>Gbor Somlyai is a molecular biologist. Having finished his studies in 1982, he worked in the field of genetic engineering and gene mapping in Germany (1988 - Georg-August University, Gttingen) and in the USA (University of Missouri Columbia, Columbia). He was first inspired by Hungarian Nobel-prize winner Albert Szent-Gyrgyi, who believed that the true cause of cancer might be found at sub-molecular level. Somlyai began his investigations in 1990 with the examination of whether the naturally occurring deuterium - the heavy isotope of hydrogen - plays any role in the regulation of biological, i.e. intracellular molecular processes. His investigation was quite unique. The existence of deuterium has been known for nearly seventy years, and it is also known that it behaves differently from hydrogen and that in our body deuterium is present in 12-14 mmol/L concentration. Yet, nobody before had ever investigated the possible role of naturally occurring deuterium in living organism.</p><h2>Honda Civic and CRV, 2001-04 (Haynes Repair Manuals)</h2><p>Total Car Care is the most complete, step-by-step automotive repair manual you&#39;ll ever use.

In <em>Single By Chance, Mothers By Choice</em>, Rosanna Hertz offers the first full-scale account of this fast-growing phenomenon, revealing why these middle class women took this unorthodox path and how they have managed to make single parenthood work for them.<br> Hertz interviewed 65 women--ranging from physicians and financial analysts to social workers, teachers, and secretaries--women who speak candidly about how they manage their lives and families as single mothers. What Hertz discovers are not ideologues but reluctant revolutionaries, women who--whether straight or gay--struggle to conform to the conventional definitions of mother, child, and family. Having tossed out the rulebook in order to become mothers, they nonetheless adhere to time-honored rules about child-rearing. As they tell their stories, they shed light on their paths to motherhood, describing how they summoned up the courage to pursue their dream, how they broke the news to parents, siblings, friends, and co-workers, how they went about buying sperm from fertility banks or adopting children of different races. They recount how their personal and social histories intersected to enable them to pursue their dream of motherhood, and how they navigate daily life. What does it mean to be 'single' in terms of romance and parenting? How do women juggle earning a paycheck with parenting? What creative ways have women devised to shore up these families? How do they incorporate men into their child-centered families? This book provides concrete, informative answers to all these questions. <br> A unique window on the future of the family, this book offers a gold mine of insight and reassurance for any woman contemplating this rewarding if unconventional step.<br></p><p>Advance Praise for <i>Single by Chance, Mothers by Choice</i> <p>"<i>Single by Chance, Mothers by Choice</i> takes us on a thought-provoking journey with several single women facing the challenge of how to become a mother without a spouse.

Too often studies of this kind offer a snapshot of a moment in time, but here Dr. Hertz gives us a movie--a sifting, changing and evolving portrait that takes us from the difficult moment of decision to the present, from anxious new mothers wondering whether they could do it, to women and their children who have written a different kind of family narrative." -- Lillian B. Rubin, Ph.D, author of <i>The Man With the Beautiful Voice</i> and <i>Worlds of Pain</i></p> <p>"In this page-turner of a book Rosanna Hertz follows the lives of middle-class single women who choose to become mothers without husbands or partners. Through vivid portraits and interviews, the romantic ideals and day-to-day complexities of single parenting come alive--all carefully portrayed within an historical and sociological context. This is a notable contribution to our understanding of how changing norms, changing technology, and changing laws are creating new family dynamics in modern America." -- Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, President, American Sociological Association</p> <p>"Single mothers have been in the cross-hairs ever since Dan Quayle attacked TV's 'Murphy Brown' for 'mocking fatherhood' by having a child without being married. But Rosanna Hertz's fascinating in-depth study shows that the former Vice President was wrong. Today's Murphy Browns--middle-class, self-supporting single mothers by choice--are not trying to score ideological points. Rather, their commitment to motherhood survives the fading of their hopes for marriage.

They discuss the apostle Peter and Roman Emperor Constantine, describe the role of Charlemagne in the expansion of the religion, and assess medieval scholasticism and the influence of Thomas Aquinas. The profound changes that occurred during both the Reformation and the Enlightenment are fully treated in chapters that offer revealing portraits of such key figures as Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, Wesley, and Rousseau. Fully one third of the book covers Christianity since 1800--with special studies of the faith as practiced in Britain and Europe, North and South America, Africa, India, and the Far East--offering a compelling continuous narrative filled with insight into the enormously diverse Christian world. In the final chapters, the authors consider questions of contemporary Christian theology, conscience and belief, and explore new concepts of Christian community.<br> Over 350 beautiful illustrations--including 32 full color plates--grace the text, ranging from mosaics, paintings and sculptures, to architecture and modern art. There are also ten maps, a chronology of important events, and an annotated guide to further reading.<br> Throughout, the book reflects the changing world in which Christians have found themselves, and the many ways in which, individually and through the institutions of the church, they in turn have influenced history.

Kennedy. The trial and the events leading up to it were headline news internationally for almost three years in the late 1960s. Those who dismissed the Warren Report as government cover-up now saw the conspiracy that they had always suspected slowly being unraveled before their eyes.</p><p>Lambert is a writer/editor.Revisionist history confronts revisionist history as the author debunks the conspiracy theory surrounding the assassination of John Kennedy that persists to this day. In March of 1967, Clay Shaw was arrested by flamboyant Now Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison and charged with conspiring to murder the president. Behind the arrest lay months and years of investigation. Shaw was linked to another conspirator, David Ferrie, and to Lee Harvey Oswald himself. (Ferrie's library card was found in Oswald's pocket on the day he shot Kennedy.) Eyewitnesses saw the three together, mysteriously appearing in the small town of Clinton, La. Another witness described their open talk of killing the president. Links were found to anti-Castro Cubans, the Mafia, the CIA. Shaw was shown to be a sadistic homosexual who wished to kill the president for the kinky thrill of it. Oliver Stone made a successful film of the story. The only trouble is, according to Lambert, it's all a pack of lies, based on deception, innuendo, hatred, ambition, and stupidity. The whole thing started when two down-and-outers on the New Orleans scene made up a couple stories, and Garrison, always ambitious, chose to believe and pursue them, though the men later recanted. Lambert does an amazing job of meticulously revealing the truth behind the lies. Through exhaustive research, countless interviews, endless reviews of Garrison's investigations and findings, she convincingly destroys virtually all the elements of the conspiracy theory Garrison so carefully wove. Here Garrison is no admirable Kevin Costner, but rather a hateful homophobic egomaniac willfully destroying an innocent man. Shaw was, after all, acquitted. Here Stone is no daring filmmaker, but a foolish, gullible man willing to believe anything. And in an America ever mistrustful of its government, both are all to readily believed. While flawed (Lambert pursues her own character assassinations at times), this is investigative reporting at its finest. It should put to rest at least some of the conspiracy notions surrounding JFK's death. But it probably won't. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Barnett <p><i>Quantum Mechanics</i> aims to teach those parts of the subject which every physicist should know. The object is to display the inherent structure of quantum mechanics, concentrating on general principles and on methods of wide applicability without taking them to their full generality. This book will equip students to follow quantum-mechanical arguments in books and scientific papers, and to cope with simple cases. To bring the subject to life, the theory is applied to the all-important field of atomic physics. No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is assumed. However, it would help most readers to have met some elementary wave mechanics before. Primarily written for students, it should also be of interest to experimental research workers who require a good grasp of quantum mechanics without the full formalism needed by the professional theorist. <i>Quantum Mechanics</i> features:</p> <ul> <li>A flow diagram allowing topics to be studied in different orders or omitted altogether.</li> <li>Optional "starred" and highlighted sections containing more advanced and specialized material for the more ambitious reader.</li> <li>Sets of problems at the end of each chapter to help student understanding.

This is especially true of books created during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, what could be called the golden age of children&#x2019;s book publishing. During this time, advances in printing and more eclectic tastes made for the most colorful and daring books of all. Now this treasury of children&#x2019;s book covers from the late 1800s to the mid-1900s reviews the full parade of this era&#x2019;s marvelous cover art, from brilliantly illustrated fairy tales to early editions of such favorites as <i>Curious George Takes a Job</i>, <i>The Little Prince</i>, <i>Charlotte&#x2019;s Web</i>, <i>Babar&#x2019;s Picnic</i>, <i>Hansel and Gretel</i>, <i>Cinderella</i>, <i>Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland</i>, and other classics. The masterful work of Walter Crane, Maurice Sendak, Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss), Beatrix Potter, and many others is well represented, and captions offer notes and details about each book, artist, and era. Sure to spark fond memories for those who loved books when they were kids, <i>From Mother Goose to Dr. Seuss</i> is also made to order for bibliophiles, artists, illustrators, and designers.</p><p>Any bookworm will admit it: you <i>can</i> judge a book by its cover. Especially a children's book cover, which is usually created by the story illustrator and therefore gives a big taste of what's to come. In this glorious compendium of children's book covers from 1860 to 1960, readers get a veritable feast for their eyes. Beautifully arranged reproductions of the covers are captioned with brief explications of the historical and technological context of the artwork and interesting tidbits of information. Did you know that 25 years before <i>Pat the Bunny</i> was published, the cover of a book called <i>The Children's Companion</i> included a dog with a furry cloth body?<p> Painstakingly organized by decade, with additional chapters on series books, multiple covers for the same theme, shaped books, back covers, and more, the book surveys the broad spectrum of picture book cover concepts and techniques over the years. From anonymous artists to well-known illustrators such as Kate Greenaway and Dr. Seuss, and from plain, functional wrapping to elaborately embellished Victorian borders and lettering, these covers capture the history of children's literature almost as well as the text within. In addition to carefully tracing the evolution of this unique art form, <i>From Mother Goose to Dr. Seuss</i> will make an exquisite addition to the collection of any artist, parent, art historian, graphic designer, collector, or avid reader. <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Harold Darling lives in Washington where he has an extensive collection of children&#39;s books.</p><h2>Essentials of Health Care Finance</h2><p>Essentials of Health Care Finance stands firmly in its place as the leading textbook on healthcare finance.

(Loeb Classical Library No. 299) (Volume III)</h2><p><p>Demosthenes (384&#x2013;322 BCE), orator at Athens, was a pleader in law courts who later became also a statesman, champion of the past greatness of his city and the present resistance of Greece to the rise of Philip of Macedon to supremacy. We possess by him political speeches and law-court speeches composed for parties in private cases and political cases. His early reputation as the best of Greek orators rests on his steadfastness of purpose, his sincerity, his clear and pungent argument, and his severe control of language.

In this unique and comprehensive introduction to the region's three major civilizations, <em>Egypt, Greece, and Rome</em> draws a fascinating picture of the deep links between the cultures across the Mediterranean and explores the ways in which these civilizations continue to be influential to this day.<br> Beginning with the emergence of the earliest Egyptian civilization around 3500 BC, Charles Freeman follows the history of the Mediterranean over a span of four millennia to AD 600, beyond the fall of the Roman empire in the west to the emergence of the Byzantine empire in the east. In addition to the three great civilizations, the peoples of the Ancient Near East and other lesser-known cultures such as the Etruscans, Celts, Persians, and Phoenicians are explored. The author examines the art, architecture, philosophy, literature, and religious practices of each culture, set against its social, political, and economic background. More than an overview of the primary political or military events, <em>Egypt, Greece, and Rome</em> pays particular attention to the actual lives of both the everyday person and the aristocracy: here is history brought to life. Especially striking are the readable and stimulating profiles of key individuals throughout the ancient world, covering persons from Homer to Horace, the Pharaoh Akhenaten to the emperor Augustus, Alexander the Great to Julius Caesar, Jesus to Justinian, and Aristotle to Augustine.<br> Generously illustrated in both color and black-and-white, and drawing on the most up-to-date scholarship, <em>Egypt, Greece and Rome</em> is a superb introduction for anyone seeking a better understanding of the civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean and their legacy to the West.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Charles Freeman</strong> is a freelance writer living in the United Kingdom. He has been described as "full of the romance of archeology and the people who created it, and full of curiosity about the human side of the ancient world".<br>With this volume, Freeman (The Ancient Greeks, Oxford Univ., 1996) has written a useful introduction to three significant ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean littoral. While some may question the inclusion of Egyptian civilization in a volume largely surveying classical civilization, the author persuasively presents Egypt and the ancient Near East as strong influences, if not precursors, of classical civilization. Although most recent volumes of the ancient world have been anthologies (e.g., The Oxford History of the Classical World, Oxford Univ., 1986), with different specialists responsible for contributing chapters, Freeman elected to consult various specialists in ancient history when composing his work but assumes sole responsibility for the final presentation. Acknowledging that ancient studies are not free of controversies, the author unfortunately does not feel that a survey volume of this type is the right forum in which to air them. Still, this work is a useful introduction to the ancient Mediterranean civilizations. Highly recommended for public and academic libraries.?Robert J.

Through effective comparative analysis of key issues in urban studies--how city managers share power with mayors, how spending policies affect economic development, and how school politics impact education policy--students can clearly see how scholars discern patterns and formulate conclusions to offer theoretical and practical insights from which all cities can benefit.Pelissero brings together an impressive team of contributors to explore variation among cities through case studies and cross-sectional analyses. Each author synthesizes the field&#39;s seminal literature while explaining how urban leaders and their constituents grapple with everything from city council politics to conflict and cooperation among minority groups. Authors identify both key trends and gaps in the scholarship, and help set the research agenda for the years to come. Lively case material will hook your students while the accessible presentation of empirical evidence make this reader the comprehensive and sophisticated text you demand.</p><p><p><b>John P.

Now a mountaineering classic, this pioneering book was the first to synthesize into a single, riveting narrative all of the varied aspects of human endeavor related to the history of the Sierra Nevada. Thoroughly illustrated with photographs, drawings, and maps, the book continues to be indispensable for any lover of the high country.</p><p><b>Francis P.

In the popular imagination, the civil rights movement is remembered in dramatic photographs of protestors attacked with police dogs and fire hoses, firebombs and shotguns, tear gas and billy clubs. The most famous images of the era show black activists victimized by violent Southern whites.<br> <br> But there are other stories to be told. Blacks changed America through their action, not their suffering. In this groundbreaking catalogue, Martin Berger presents a collection of forgotten photographs that illustrate the action, heroism, and strength of black activists in driving social and legislative change. <i>Freedom Now!</i> highlights the power wielded by black men, women, and children in courthouses, community centers, department stores, political conventions, schools, and streets.<br> <br> <i>Freedom Now! </i>reveals that we have inherited a photographic canon&#x2015;and a picture of history&#x2015;shaped by whites&#x2019; comfort with unthreatening images of victimized blacks. And it illustrates how and why particular people, events, and issues have been edited out of the photographic story we tell about our past. By considering the different values promoted in the forgotten photographs, readers will gain an understanding of African Americans&#x2019; role in rewriting U.S. history and the high stakes involved in selecting images with which to narrate our collective past.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Martin A.

The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King&#x2019;s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. She was born on May 26, 1583. Twins, a boy, Hamnet ( who would die at age eleven), and a girl, Judith, were born in 1585. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. A rival dramatist, Robert Greene, referred to him as &#x201c;an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers.&#x201d; Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men (later under James I, called the King&#x2019;s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time, including Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and Robert Armin. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, including <i>Sir Thomas More</i> and <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and he wrote poems, including <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays as <b>The Tempest</b> and <b>Henry VII</b> until about 1613. He died on April 23 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford.

His work is centred on two main themes: his father's retreat from France through the port of Cherbourg in June 1940, after the evacuation of Dunkirk; and the advance in Italy in 1944, including the Battle of Monte Cassino.<br>O'Donoghue sees his body of work on the theme of war as "a visual equivalent of the Classical epic poem, with individual pictures functioning like chapters, verses, or lines". The analogy is carried through into the works themselves, many of which tell their often complicated story in a strikingly visual, semi-abstracted way through metaphor, symbolism and references that derive from ancient Greek mythology. The story of the individual, of the artist's father, thereby becomes the story of Everyman - a story at once intimate and anonymous. In this, the first major study of O'Donoghue's work, the themes of history, memory and identity are explored.</p><p>James Hamilton is University Curator at the University of Birmingham.</p><h2>Guinness World Records 2019</h2><p><p>The world&#x2019;s most popular record book is back with thousands of new categories and newly broken records, covering everything from outer space to sporting greats via Instagram, fidget spinners and all manner of human marvels.

In the 4th century CE, Calcidius translated into Latin an important section of Plato&#x2019;s <i>Timaeus</i>, complemented by extensive commentary and organized into coordinated parts. The first part is broadly devoted to the architecture of the world, to its intelligible structure. The second delves into the nature of the living creatures that inhabit it. This basic division subsequently informed the sense of macrocosm and microcosm&#x2015;of the world and our place in it&#x2015;which is prevalent in western European thought in the Middle Ages. At the same time, this medieval volume altered perspectives on Plato by drawing on other philosophical traditions, particularly the Stoic and Peripatetic, while including Judeo-Christian cosmology and anthropology. The present edition provides the first English translation of Calcidius&#x2019;s work.</p><p><p>John Magee is Professor of Classics and Medieval Studies at the University of Toronto.</p></p><h2>Bake with Anna Olson: More than 125 Simple, Scrumptious and Sensational Recipes to Make You a Better Baker: A Baking Book</h2><p><b>Take your baking from simple to sensational with Anna Olson's comprehensive guide to beautiful baked goods.&nbsp;<i>Bake with Anna Olson&nbsp;</i>features more than 125 recipes from her popular Food Network Canada show.</b><br>From chocolate chip cookies to croquembouche, pumpkin pie to petits fours, Anna Olson's newest baking book is full of delectable delights for every occasion, category and skill level.

A defender of Copernicus' s sun-centered universe, he famously discovered that planets move in ellipses, and defined the three laws of planetary motion. Perhaps less well known is that in 1615, when Kepler was at the height of his career, his widowed mother Katharina was accused of witchcraft. The proceedings led to a criminal trial that lasted six years, with Kepler conducting his mother's defense. <br><br>In <em>The Astronomer and the Witch</em>, Ulinka Rublack pieces together the tale of this extraordinary episode in Kepler's life, one which takes us to the heart of his changing world. First and foremost an intense family drama, the story brings to life the world of a small Lutheran community in the centre of Europe at a time of deep religious and political turmoil--a century after the Reformation, and on the threshold of the Thirty Years' War.<br><br>Kepler's defense of his mother also offers us a fascinating glimpse into the great astronomer's world view, on the cusp between Reformation and scientific revolution. While advancing rational explanations for the phenomena which his mother's accusers attributed to witchcraft, Kepler nevertheless did not call into question the <em>existence</em> of magic and witches. On the contrary, he clearly believed in them. And, as the story unfolds, it appears that there were moments when even Katharina's children wondered whether their mother really did have nothing to hide...<br></p><p><br><strong>Ulinka Rublack</strong> is Professor at the University of Cambridge and has published widely on early modern European history as well as approaches to history. She edited the <em>Oxford Concise Companion to History</em> (2011), and, most recently, the <em>Oxford Handbook of the Protestant Reformation</em> (2016). Her monographs include <em>Reformation Europe</em> (2005), <em>The Crimes of Women in Early Modern Germany</em> (1999), and <em>Dressing Up: Cultural Identity in Renaissance Europe</em> (2010), which won the Roland H. Bainton Prize.<br><br>"Rublack has written a forceful book....It is a breath-taking account of a brave family who boldly fought for justice. A wide audience of readers will affirm the simple principle that history at its best is profoundly personal."--<em>Early Science and Medicine</em><p></p><br>"Excellent...meticulously researched and wonderfully readable."--John Banville, <em>Literary Review</em><p></p><br>"An enthralling book."--Jennifer Rampling, <em>Nature</em><p></p><br>"Rublack tells [this] story with a novelist's panache. Even if you know what happened, it's a compelling book. She sketches the vivid details that make the time, place and characters come to life....The Tale of the Witch and the Mathematician--unmissable."--Mark Greener, <em>Fortean Times</em><p></p><br></p><h2>To Run a Constitution: The Legitimacy of the Administrative State</h2><p>In 1887, the centennial year of the American Constitution, Woodrow Wilson wrote that "it is getting to be harder to run a constitution than to frame one." The context for Wilson's comment was an essay calling for sound principles of administration that would enable government officials to "run" a constitution well. Wilson and his fellow civil-service reformers had a profound influence on the development of American administrative institutions. Unfortunately, the reformers paid more attention to the exigencies of running a constitution than to the Constitution itself. They and their intellectual progeny developed a theory of administration that was at odds with the theory of the Constitution. As a result, we find ourselves living today in what we often call an "administrative state"&#x2014;a state seemingly bereft of legitimating principles grounded in the political thought of the framers of the Constitution.<br><br>In <i>To Run a Constitution</i>, John A. Rohr takes seriously two basic premises: de Tocqueville's belief that citizens are corrupted by obeying powers they believe to be illegitimate, and the view that, despite present political sentiment, the administrative state is here to stay. The book focuses on the important question of whether the administrative state, an abiding presence in American politics, can be justified in terms of the American constitutional tradition.<br><br>In addressing this question, Rohr goes beyond considerations of case law to examine the principles of the Constitution both at its founding and in its subsequent development. Reying on the normative character of political "foundings," Rohr analyzes three significant founding periods: 1) the founding of the Republic, 1787-1795; 2) the foundin of public administration, 1883-1899; and 3) the founding of the administrative state, 1933-1941. He judges the last two foundings by the first in developing his argument that the modern administrative state can be justified in terms of the kind of government the framers of the Constitution envisaged.<br><br>On the eve of the bicentennial of the Constitution, Rohr's argument advances a new, normative theory of public administration that is intended to "support and defend the Constitution of the United States," in accordance with the oath of office taken by public administrators. It is critical reading for scholars in the fields of public administration, political science, and constitutional studies.</p><p>"Building upon the avowal that 'there is need for a normative theory of public administration that is grounded in the Constitution,' Rohr derives and delineates with meticulous regard for constitutional text and historical context the founding and development of the administrative state in word and deed. Conscientiousness, candor, and conscience pervade his incisive analyses, cogent arguments, and enticing urbane chatting with the reader in this landmark study of Constitutional legitimacy"--Victor Rosenblum, coauthor of <i>Constitutional Law: Political Roles of the Supreme Court</i> <p>"A forcefully argued point of view . . . certain to engage the field in constructive argumentation over fundamental issues ranging from constitutional foundations . . . to the current meaning and force of the public administrator's oath to uphold the Constitution."--Chester A. Newland, Editor-in-Chief, <i>Public Administration Review</i> </p><p>"In a complex argument that combines boldness with impressive scholarship, Rohr seeks to legitimize the administrative state in history, law, and 'principles.' This is a major addition to the literature of public administration, and henceforth all who would be knowledgeable in that area will need to have an informed opinion on the positions it takes."--Dwight Waldo, author of <i>The Administrative State</i> </p><p>"This is a broad, sweeping, synthesizing account that rests on a firm grasp of constitutional history and principle."--Herman Belz, coauthor of <i>The American Constitution: Its Origin and Development</i> </p><p>"A very important book that should be required reading for all public administrators in the United States. . . . The scholarship is the strongest of any book published in public administration in a decade or more. It will be a classic."--David H. Rosenbloom, author of <i>Public Administration and Law</i></p>John A. Rohr is a professor of public administration at the Center for Public Administration and Policy at Virginia Polytechnic Institute. A recipient of the ASPA Distinguished Research Award, he is the author of five other books, including <i>Public Service, Ethics, and Constitutional Practice,</i> and <i>Founding Republics in France and America: A Study in Constitutional Governance</i>. Rohr was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow for the 1998-99 academic year.</p><h2>Insider/Outsider: American Jews and Multiculturalism</h2><p>Twelve distinguished historians, political theorists, and literary critics present new perspectives on multiculturalism in this important collection. Central to the essays (all but one is appearing in print for the first time) is the question of how the Jewish experience can challenge the conventional polar opposition between a majority "white monoculture" and a marginalized "minorities of color multiculture." This book takes issue with such a dichotomy by showing how experiences of American Jews can undo conventional categories. Neither a complaint against multiculturalism by Jews who feel excluded from it, nor a celebration of multiculturalism as the solution to contemporary Jewish problems, <i>Insider/Outsider</i> explores how the Jews' anomalous status opens up multicultural history in different and interesting directions. The goal of the editors has been to transcend the notion of "comparative victimology" and to show the value of a narrative that does not rely on competing histories of persecution. Readers can discover in these essays arguments that will broaden their understanding of Jewish identity and multicultural theory and will enliven the contemporary debate about American culture generally.</p><p>"Invaluable reading for anyone interested in multiculturalism."&#x2015;Julius Lester, author of <i>Lovesong</i><br><br>"I know of no other work that, through numerous insights and useful distinctions, so alerts us to and comprehensively documents the ongoing constitutive role of Christian and anti-semitic perceptions of Jewish existence and the interactions between them. Whereas much contemporary historiography has become so specialized that historians have surrendered the larger picture, Biale's panoramic perspective reveals the great value and interest of this work."&#x2015;Steven E.

William Doyle has done this in a brief, clear, and thoughtful book."--<em>Journal of Modern History</em><p></p><br>"The book is well conceived and refreshing, and demonstrates Doyle's mastery of both older and more recent scholarship....An impressive piece of historical writing and an important contribution to French revolutionary scholarship."--<em>The Historian</em><p></p><br>"His work will become a standard synthesis of recent scholarship on the causes of the Revolution."--<em>Eighteenth-Century Studies</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Theory of Economic Development (Social Science Classics Series)</h2><p><p>Schumpeter proclaims in this classical analysis of capitalist society first published in 1911 that economics is a natural self-regulating mechanism when undisturbed by "social and other meddlers." In his preface he argues that despite weaknesses, theories are based on logic and provide structure for understanding fact.</p> <p>Of those who argue against him, Schumpeter asks a fundamental question: "Is it really artificial to keep separate the phenomena incidental to running a firm and the phenomena incidental to creating a new one?" In his answers, Schumpeter offers guidance to Third World politicians no less than First World businesspeople.</p> <p>In his substantial new introduction, John E. Elliott discusses the salient ideas of The Theory of Economic Development against the historical background of three great periods of economic thought in the last two decades.</p></p><p><p>Joseph A. Schumpeter (1883-1950) was professor of economics at the University of Graz and at Bonn University. He also served as Austrian minister of finance.

The bywords of media communication are interconnectivity, interactivity, and mobility. The fourth edition of Media Relations in Sport provides readers information on the current trends and emerging areas in the field of sport communication from technology to social media to how the global outreach of sport has affected the sports media profession. While the fourth edition rightly goes into emerging areas of the field, it also retains the focus of the first three editions, specifically on the basics and principles of sports media that remain its foundations. Any student interested in a career in sports media has to know certain essentials -- how to interview, how to effectively create and distribute content, and how to deal with communications problems that will invariably arise. All of these subjects and more are addressed, as are more specialised topics such as those dealing with event management, publicity campaigns, and ethics.</p><p>Brad Schultz, PhD, is an associate professor in the School of Journalism and New Media at the University of Mississippi.

To attain this goal, the authors have supplemented the traditional case method in two significant ways. First, because the law of evidence has engendered a vast and rich literature, the authors have drawn extensively, but selectively, on these scholarly writings to provide the initial insight and sense of perspective on the principles of evidence. Each article excerpts is chosen for its ability to concisely explain the evidentiary rule. <p></p><p>Second, the authors have included numerous transcript materials from celebrated trials. These transcript excerpts from cases like the trials of Lizzie Borden, O.J. Simpson, John Scopes, Alger Hiss, the Rosenbergs, Charles Manson, and Sacco and Vanzetti bring evidence theory to life in the courtroom. These excerpts enable students to see how the foundations are laid and objections made.</p></p><p></p><h2>Discovering Statistics Using IBM SPSS Statistics</h2><p>With an exciting new look, new characters to meet, and its unique combination of humour and step-by-step instruction, this award-winning book is the statistics lifesaver for everyone.

Censored upon publication in 1871, out of print since the 1950s, and untranslated for a century, Zola&#x2019;s <i>The Kill</i> (La Cur�e) emerges as an unheralded classic of naturalism. Second in the author&#x2019;s twenty-volume <i>Rougon-Macquart</i> saga, it is a riveting story of family transgression, heedless desire, and societal greed.<br><br>The incestuous affair of Ren�e Saccard and her stepson, Maxime, is set against the frenzied speculation of Ren�e&#x2019;s financier husband, Aristide, in a Paris becoming a modern metropolis and &#x201c;the capital of the nineteenth century.&#x201d; In the end, setting and story merge in actions that leave a woman&#x2019;s spirit and a city&#x2019;s soul ravaged beyond repair. As vividly rendered by Arthur Goldhammer, one of the world&#x2019;s premier translators from the French, <i>The Kill</i> contains all the qualities of the school of fiction marked, as Henry James wrote, by &#x201c;infernal intelligence.&#x201d;<br><br>In this new incarnation, <i>The Kill</i> joins <i>Nana</i> and <i>Germinal</i> on the shelf of Zola classics, works by an immortal author who&#x2013;explicit, pitiless, wise, and unrelenting&#x2013;always goes in for the kill.</p><p><b>�mile Zola</b> was born in 1840 and worked as a journalist before turning to fiction. He wrote his first major novel, <i>Th�r�se Raquin</i>, in 1867, and the publication of <i>L&#x2019;Assommoir</i> ten years later made him the most famous writer in France. His work has influenced authors from August Strindberg to Theodore Dreiser to Tom Wolfe. He died in 1902.1<br><br>On the way back, in the crush of carriages returning via the lakeshore, the caleche was obliged to slow to a walk. At one point the congestion became so bad that it was even forced to a stop.<br><br>The sun was setting in a light gray October sky with streaks of thin cloud on the horizon. A last ray of sunlight descending from the distant heights of the falls threaded its way along the carriageway, bathing the long line of stalled carriages in a pale reddish light. Glimmers of gold and bright flashes from the wheels seemed to cling to the straw-yellow trim of the caleche, whose deep blue side panels reflected bits of the surrounding landscape. And higher up, fully immersed in the reddish light that illuminated them from the rear and caused the brass buttons of their cloaks, half-folded over the back of the seat, to glow, the coachman and footman in their dark blue livery, putty-colored breeches, and striped black-and-yellow waistcoats held themselves erect, grave and patient, as was only proper for the servants of a good house whom no crush of carriages would ever succeed in ruffling. Their hats, ornamented with black crests, possessed great dignity. Only the horses--a superb pair of bays--snorted with impatience.<br><br>"Look over there," said Maxime. "Laure d'Aurigny, in that coupe. ... Do you see, Renee?"<br><br>Renee lifted herself up slightly and squinted with that exquisite pout she always made on account of her weak eyesight.<br><br>"I thought she'd run away," she said. "She's changed the color of her hair, hasn't she?"<br><br>"Yes, she has," Maxime laughed. "Her new lover can't stand red."<br><br>Renee, leaning forward with her hand resting on the low door of the caleche, stared, awakened at last from the melancholy dream that had kept her silent for the past hour as she lay stretched out in the back of the carriage like a convalescent resting on a chaise longue. Over a mauve silk dress fitted with pinafore and tunic and trimmed with wide pleated flounces, she wore a white cloth jacket with mauve velvet facings, which lent quite a swagger to her look. Her strange hair, of a pale tawny color reminiscent of the finest butter, was barely hidden by a thin hat embellished by a cluster of Bengal roses. Continuing to squint, she had the air of an impertinent youth, with a large furrow in her otherwise unblemished brow and an upper lip that protruded like a sulky child's. Because it was hard for her to see, she took her eyeglasses--a man's pince-nez with horn rims--and, holding them in her hand without setting them on her nose, examined the well-endowed Laure at her leisure and with an air of perfect calm.<br><br>The carriages remained motionless. Here and there amid the series of featureless dark patches formed by the long line of coupes--quite numerous in the Bois de Boulogne that autumn afternoon--shone the corner of a mirror or the bit of a horse or the silvered handle of a lantern or the gold braids of a footman sitting high up on his seat. Occasionally one caught a glimpse of female finery in an open landau, a flash of silk here or velvet there. Little by little a profound silence subdued all the bustle, as everything ground to a halt. Inside the carriages one heard the conversations of people passing by on foot. Mute glances were exchanged through carriage doors. All gossip had ceased, and the wait was interrupted only by the creak of a harness or the sound of a horse pawing the ground impatiently. The indistinct voices of the forest died away in the distance.<br><br>Despite the lateness of the season, all Paris was there: Duchess von Sternich in an "eight-spring"; Mme de Lauwerens in a quite handsomely rigged victoria; Baroness von Meinhold in a ravishing reddish-brown cab; Countess Wanska, with her piebald ponies; Mme Daste and her famous black "steppers"; Mme de Guende and Mme Teissiere, in a coupe; and little Sylvia in a dark blue landau. And then there was Don Carlos, in mourning, with his antiquated formal livery; Selim Pasha, with his fez and without his guardian; the duchesse de Rozan in a single-seat coupe with white-speckled livery; the comte de Chibray, in a dogcart; Mr. Simpson in the most elegant of coaches; the whole American colony; and, bringing up the rear, two academicians in a fiacre.<br><br>The first carriages finally succeeded in extricating themselves, and one by one the whole line slowly began to move. It was like an awakening. A thousand lights began to dance, flashes darted among the wheels, and harnesses glinted as teams strained against their traces. Ground and trees shimmered in what seemed like the glare of moving ice. The glitter of harnesses and wheels, the amber glow of polished panels set ablaze by the setting sun, the shrill accents added by splendid liveries set up high against the open sky and sumptuous finery spilling out over carriage doors--all of this was swept along in a dull rumble, punctuated only by the hoofbeats of trotting horses. The whole parade moved steadily along in a uniform motion, sights and sounds unvarying from first to last, as if the lead carriages were pulling the rest after them.<br><br>Renee yielded to the slight jolt of the caleche as it resumed its forward progress and, dropping her pince-nez, once again leaned back against the cushions. With a shiver she drew over herself a corner of the bearskin that filled the interior of the carriage with a layer of silky snow. Her gloved hands luxuriated in the deep, soft curls of fur. The wind had picked up. The warm October afternoon that had brought spring back to the Bois and drawn the leading lights of high society out in open carriages threatened to end in a biting evening chill.<br><br>For a short while the young woman lay huddled in her warm corner, giving herself up to the voluptuous, hypnotic motion of so many wheels turning round and round in front of her. Then she lifted up her head toward Maxime, who with his eyes was calmly undressing the women on display in the nearby coupes and landaus.<br><br>"Honestly," she asked, "do you think Laure d'Aurigny is pretty? You had nice things to say about her the other day, when the sale of her diamonds was announced! And by the way, have you seen the riviere and the aigrette your father bought me at that sale?"<br><br>Avoiding the first question, Maxime met the second with a nasty snicker. "You have to admit that he carried it off nicely. He found a way to pay off Laure's debts and give his wife diamonds at the same time."<br><br>The young woman gave a slight shrug.<br><br>"Naughty boy!" she murmured with a smile.<br><br>But the young man had leaned forward to stare at a woman whose green dress caught his eye. Renee laid her head down, her eyes half-closed, staring idly at either side of the carriageway, seeing nothing. To her right, a slow procession of shrubs and small trees with reddish foliage and slender branches slipped past. On the bridle path reserved for riders, narrow-waisted gentlemen occasionally galloped by on horses whose hooves raised small clouds of fine sand. To the left, flower beds of various shapes dotted the lawn that sloped down to the quiet lake, which was crystal clear, free of algae, and neatly edged as if by a gardener's spade. From the far side of its mirror surface rose two islands, joined by the gray hyphen of a bridge, above which loomed charming cliffs whose theatrical rows of fir and other evergreens stood out against the pale sky, while reflections of their dark foliage on the water's surface resembled the fringes of curtains artfully draped over the horizon. This little patch of nature, with its air of a freshly painted backdrop, lay immersed in a pale shadow, a bluish haze that added a finishing touch of exquisite charm, of delightful falsity, to the distances. On the other shore, the Chalet des Iles, looking freshly polished, gleamed like a brand-new toy. Snaking through the lawns of the park and around the lake, ribbons of yellow sand, narrow paths lined with the cast-iron branches of lampposts in imitation of a rustic copse, stood out in this final hour in the strangest way against the softened green of water and grass.<br><br>Accustomed to the contrived graces of these vistas, Renee, sinking back into lassitude, had closed her eyes almost completely, until all she could see was the way the long hair of the bearskin wound around the spindles of her slender fingers. But when something disrupted the regular trot of the line of carriages, she raised her head and nodded to two young women lying side by side in amorous languor in an eight-spring that had noisily turned off onto a side path leading away from the lakeshore. Mme la marquise d'Espanet, whose husband, to the great scandal of the recalcitrant old nobility, had recently embraced the imperial cause and accepted a position as aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was one of the most illustrious socialites of the Second Empire. The other woman, Mme Haffner, had married a well-known industrialist from Colmar, a millionaire twenty times over, whom the Empire was turning into a politician. Renee had known both women since boarding school, where others had referred to them with a knowing air as "the two Inseparables." She called them by their first names, Adeline and Suzanne. After smiling at them, she curled up once more, but a laugh from Maxime made her turn around.<br><br>"No, really, I'm sad. Don't laugh, this is serious," she said on seeing that the young man was contemplating her with a mocking eye, making fun of her reclining posture.<br><br>Maxime replied in a queer tone.<br><br>"So we're really hurt, are we? Really jealous?"<br><br>She seemed taken aback.<br><br>"Me! Why would I be jealous?"<br><br>Then, as if remembering, she added with her disdainful pout, "Oh, yes, of course, that fat cow Laure! As if I cared. If what everybody wants me to believe is true, and Aristide really paid that whore's debts...</p><h2>David Busch&#39;s Nikon D3s/D3x Guide to Digital SLR Photography (David Busch&#39;s Digital Photography Guides)</h2><p>After upgrading to the Nikon D3/D3x, &#34;David Busch&#39;s Nikon D3/D3x Guide to Digital SLR Photography&#34; will help you maximize your experience with your new camera.

Nancy J. Weiss shows that blacks became Democrats in response to the economic benefits of the New Deal and that they voted for Franklin Roosevelt in spite of the New Deal's lack of a substantive record on race.</p><br><p> By their support for FDR blacks forged a political commitment to the Democratic party that has lasted to our own time. The last group to join the New Deal coalition, they have been the group that remained the most loyal to the Democratic party. This book explains the sources of their commitment in the 1930s. It stresses the central role of economic concerns in shaping black political behavior and clarifies both the New Deal record on race and the extraordinary relationship between black voters and the Roosevelts.</p></p><p><p>"An excellent piece of work that will make a significant contribution to our understanding of the New Deal as well as the experience of black Americans during the 1930s."--<b>William H.

Some of Trollope's best-loved works revolve around the imaginary county of Barsetshire, but he also wrote penetrating novels on political, social, and gender issues and<br>conflicts of his day.Novel by Anthony Trollope, first published serially from July 1873 to January 1874 and in two volumes in 1874. It is a sequel to Phineas Finn and the fourth of the PALLISER NOVELS. The narrative begins after Finn's wife, Mary, has died in childbirth.

An ethical and kind man, Finn is falsely accused of the murder of a rival politician. Eventually acquitted, he leaves political life in disgust. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>War and Peace</h2><p>A new version -- the one Tolstoy originally intended, but has been hitherto unpublished -- of Russia&#39;s most famous novel; with a different ending, fewer digressions and an altered view of Napoleon -- it&#39;s time to look afresh at one of the world&#39;s favourite books. &#39;War and Peace&#39; is a masterpiece -- a panoramic portrait of Russian society and its descent into the Napoleonic Wars which for over a century has inspired reverential devotion among its readers. This new version is certain to provoke controversy and devotion in equal measures. A &#39;first draft&#39; of the epic version known to all, it was completed in 1866 but never published. A closely guarded secret for a century and a half, the unveiling of the original version of &#39;War and Peace&#39;, with an ending different to that we all know, is of huge significance to students of Tolstoy. But it is also sure to prove fascinating to the general reader who will find it an invigorating and absorbing read. Free of the solemn philosophical wanderings, the drama and tragedy of this sweeping tale is reinforced. His characters remain central throughout, emphasising their own personal journeys, their loves and passions, their successes and failures and their own personal tragedies. 500 pages shorter, this is historical fiction at its most vivid and vital, and readers will marvel anew at Tolstoy&#39;s unique ability to conjure the lives and souls of Russia and the Russians in all their glory. For devotees who long for more, for those who struggled and didn&#39;t quite make it to the end, or for those who have always wanted to know what all the fuss is about, this is essential reading.</p><p>Leo Tolstoy was born in 1828 in Tula, near Moscow. His parents, who both died when he was young, belonged to the Russian nobility, and to the end of his life Tolstoy remained conscious of his aristocratic status. His novels, &#39;War and Peace&#39; and &#39;Anna Karenina&#39; are literary classics and he is revered as one of the greatest writers of the nineteenth century. He died in 1910 at the age of 82. Andrew Bromfield was born in Yorkshire and lives in Surrey, having spent several long periods living in Moscow, where he cofounded and edited &#39;Glas&#39;. He is best known for his English translations of the work of Victor Pelevin and Boris Akunin.&#39;The greatest of all novelists -- for what else can we call the author of &#34;War and Peace&#34;?&#39; Virginia Woolf &#39;The pure narrative power of Tolstoy&#39;s work is unequalled. To read him is to find one&#39;s way home, to everything within us that is fundamental and sane.&#39; Thomas Mann &#39;What an artist and what a psychologist!

Designed by the acclaimed Coralie Bickford-Smith and beautifully set, these slim, A format volumes are the ultimate gift editions for poetry lovers. Wessex Poems was Hardy&#39;s first collection of poetry, published after he had turned away from novel writing, disillusioned by the savage reception Jude the Obscure had received. Its publication marked the start of an extraordinary new phase in Hardy&#39;s writing career: for the rest of his long life, he would write only poetry. Here are sprightly Dorset ballads, verses set during the Napoleonic Wars, and personal poems reflecting on Hardy&#39;s life and loves. Composed throughout Hardy&#39;s life and animated by his affection for his beloved Wessex, their publication in 1898 heralded the arrival of a major new poetic voice.</p><p>Thomas Hardy was born in Dorset in 1840 and became an apprentice architect at the age of sixteen. He spent his twenties in London, where he wrote his first poems. In 1867 Hardy returned to his native Dorset, whose rugged landscape was a great source of inspiration for his writing. Between 1871 and 1897 he wrote fourteen novels, including Tess of the D&#39;Urbervilles and Jude the Obscure. This final work was received savagely; thereafter Hardy turned away from novels and spent the last thirty year of his life focusing on poetry. He died in 1928.</p><h2>TransHuman Space: Fifth Wave</h2><p>The Third Wave was information. The Fourth Wave was biotech.

Coming to England aged 16, she drifted into various jobs before starting to write in Paris in the late 1920&#39;s.

Original.</p><p><p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Ensconced in his center seat, Captain James T. Kirk readjusted the cast on his left hand and regarded his bridge's forward viewscreen, where the planet of his birth was depicted in all its deep blue, cloudswaddled glory. At any other time in his life, the captain would have looked on the sight with gladness and anticipation. </p><p> Gladness, because there was something in every man that responded warmly to the sight of the familiar and the traditional. Anticipation, because there were people who loved him on Earth, people whose embrace Kirk would have sought out at his earliest opportunity. </p><p> But this time, there was no gladness in his heart, no warmth, no anticipation. There would be no fond reunions with relatives and old cronies lasting long into the night. </p><p> After all, the captain was still reflecting on the death of a friend. And not just any friend. </p><p> He and Gary Mitchell had been buddies almost since their first encounter at Starfleet Academy fifteen years earlier. They had served on three different ships together, rescuing each other from deadly peril more times than either of them had cared to count. </p><p> Then that string of rescues had ended. A peril had come along that was so staggering, so unimaginable, that Kirk hadn't been able to save his pal's life. On the contrary... </p><p> He was the one who had taken it. </p><p> Sometime later, in the irony to end all ironies, Gary's parents had informed the captain that they wanted him to speak at their son's funeral service. In fact, they wanted him to deliver the eulogy, since he was both Gary's commanding officer and his closest friend. </p><p> Under other circumstances, it would have been an honor for Kirk, albeit a sad one. It would have been an opportunity to pay tribute to his friend's memory. But under these circumstances, it was a nightmare. </p><p> How could he stand up at Gary's funeral and speak of his death as if it were someone else's doing? How could he say such a thing or even imply it, when he knew it was he who had pressed the phaser trigger and sent his friend to an early grave? </p><p> The captain sighed. "Establish synchronous orbit," he told Lieutenant Sulu, until recently his astrophysics chief and now his primary helmsman. </p><p> "Synchronous orbit," the lieutenant repeated, making the necessary adjustments on his instrument panel. </p><p> "Captain Kirk," said Dezago, the communications officer. "They're ready for you in the transporter room.?" </p><p> Kirk swung around in his chair. "Thank you, Lieutenant," he told Dezago. "Tell them I'll be down there in a minute." </p><p> The communications officer nodded. "Aye, sir." </p><p> The captain turned to Spock, his Vulcan first officer. "You have the conn," he said. </p><p> Spock, who was seated at the science station as usual inclined his head ever so slightly. "Acknowledged," he said. </p><p> It was comforting to know he could count on someone with the Vulcan's intelligence and efficiency. In fact, Kirk would have felt comfortable leaving Spock in command even in the middle of an enemy attack. </p><p> As it was, they were in orbit around the planet where Federation headquarters was located, arguably the most secure location in the galaxy. The captain didn't anticipate trouble of any kind. </p><p> At least, not up there. </p><p> With that thought in mind, Kirk got up and headed for the turbolift. As the doors opened with a whisper of air, he entered the compartment and used his good hand to press the control stud indicating the transporter deck. The doors slid shut and he was on his way. </p><p> Less than a minute later, the lift deposited the captain at his destination. The transporter room was only a few meters away, down the corridor to the right. Still, when Kirk reached its double doors, he couldn't help hesitating for a moment. </p><p> Beyond these doors, he told himself, was change -- and quite possibly a great deal of it. When he came back the next day, his sojourn on Earth complete, things would be different. </p><p> There would be personnel alterations at the very least. New faces coming, familiar ones going. But it was the face of the man sitting in the captain's chair that he was most concerned about at the moment. </p><p> What kind of person would he be when he returned to the <i>Enterprise?</i> One who had come through his ordeal with his self-respect intact -- or one who had compromised himself for the sake of his duty to the point where he could no longer look at himself in the mirror? </p><p> Only time would tell. </p><p> Taking a deep breath, Kirk moved forward and saw the red orange doors part at his approach. There were four people waiting for him inside the room -- Lieutenant Kyle, who was standing behind the control console, and the three crewmen gathered on the round, slightly elevated transporter pad. </p><p> One of them was Mark Piper, who had served as chief medical officer on the <i>Enterprise</i> since the captain assumed command of the vessel a year earlier. The doctor was retiring from the fleet after a long and prestigious career to spend more time with his children and grandchildren. </p><p> On Piper's right was Daniel Alden, the <i>Enterprise's</i> primary communications officer. Alden's fianc�e had gotten a job as administrator of a Federation colony and he was leaving the ship to be with her. </p><p> Yeoman Barbara Smith stood on Piper's left. An attractive woman with an efficient, thorough manner, she had somehow never clicked with Kirk. However, he knew that was his fault as much as hers, considering he had only recently managed to recall her name with any consistency. </p><p> "Captain," said Piper, as Kirk approached the platform. </p><p> "Doctor," the captain replied. Then he glanced at the others. "Alden," he said. "Smith." </p><p> "I guess this is it," said the communications officer. </p><p> The captain smiled -- first at Alden, and then at the others as well. "I guess it is," he replied. "But before you go, I want to thank you for all the good work you've done on this ship. Those you leave behind will always be in your debt." </p><p> The yeoman smiled back at him. "It's nice of you to say so, sir." </p><p> "I'd be remiss if I said anything else," Kirk told her. </p><p> "Captain," said Kyle, "they're ready to receive our friends here down at Starfleet Headquarters." </p><p> The captain nodded to show he had heard. "Thank you once again," he told the trio on the transporter pad. Then he glanced at the transporter technician and said, "Energize, Mr. Kyle." </p><p> A moment later, the air around Piper, Alden, and Smith began to shimmer with an iridescent light. Then they and the light faded to nothingness as their molecules were absorbed into the transporter's pattern buffer and sent streaming down to Earth along an annular confinement beam. </p><p> Kirk sighed and wondered if he would ever see any of them again. At the rate the Federation was growing, it seemed unlikely. But then, one never knew. </p><p> "How long before we greet our new arrivals?" he asked Kyle. </p><p> The technician consulted his instrument panel. "Not long," he told the captain. "In fact, sir, any moment now." </p><p> Right on cue, three separate forms began to take shape on the <i>Enterprise's </i>transporter platform. One of them was male, the other two female. Very female, Kirk couldn't help but notice, even before the newcomers completed the materialization process. </p><p> Under happier circumstances, he might have studied the women a little more closely. As it was, all he could think about was the friend he had left behind on Delta Vega. </p><p> "Welcome to the <i>Enterprise,"</i> he told the newcomers, knowing how flat his voice must sound to them. </p><p> The male figure, a rawboned, boyish-looking specimen, descended from the platform and held out his hand. "Pleased to meet you, Captain. Lieutenant David Bailey reporting for duty." </p><p> Despite the cast he was wearing, Kirk took the man's hand. Bailey's grip was strong and enthusiastic -- and if he hadn't held back because of the captain's injury, it might have been even more so. </p><p> Somehow, Kirk thought, frowning, David Bailey hadn't looked quite so baby faced in his Starfleet file photo. If he had, the captain might have thought twice about making the man his primary navigator. </p><p> Then again, he reminded himself, Bailey had impressed the staff of the <i>Carolina</i> with his charting abilities and his command potential. <i>I probably shouldn't be judging a book by its cover,</i> he mused. </p><p> "At ease," Kirk told the lieutenant. </p><p> Bailey smiled. "Thank you, sir." </p><p> By then, the two women had stepped down from the transporter platform as well. They flowed around Bailey as a river might flow around an especially obtrusive hunk of rock. </p><p> "Lieutenant Uhura," said one of them, a darkskinned beauty with long lashes and prominent cheekbones. "Communications," she added. </p><p> Alden's replacement, the captain remarked inwardly. He shook her hand as well -- not very warmly, he was afraid. "Uhura." </p><p> The other woman, who had flaxen hair and sparkling blue eyes, introduced herself as Janice Rand. "Yeoman," she explained, as if her uniform weren't explicit enough on that point. </p><p> "Yeoman," said Kirk. </p><p> He scrutinized the newcomers for a moment, finding intelligence and an abiding curiosity in their faces. They all seemed capable, responsible, eager. No doubt they were among the finest the fleet had to offer. </p><p> But the captain couldn't give them any guarantee they wouldn't wind up as Gary had. As Kelso had. He couldn't assure them their lives wouldn't be cut short before their curiosities were satisfied. </p><p> "Again," he said, "welcome aboard. Mr. Kyle here will be happy to direct you to your quarters, where you'll find your duty schedules posted." He frowned. "At some point, I would like to speak with each of you individually. But right now, other matters require my attention." </p><p> "Of course, sir," Bailey replied. </p><p> "Acknowledged," Uhura responded. </p><p> Kirk looked at them a moment longer, trying to see people standing there in front of him and not prospective casualties. It wasn't easy, he thought, sighing again. </p><p> Finally, he said, "Dismissed." </p><p> The newcomers moved aside for him and the captain ascended to the transporter platform. Then he turned to his transporter chief and said a single word: "Energize." </p><p><br> Uhura watched the transporter effect surround Kirk with its undulating brilliance. A moment later, he was gone. </p><p> She made her way across the room to the transporter control console. The transporter technician, a tall man with blond hair and a narrow face, was still gazing at the empty platform. </p><p> "Is he always like that?" she asked. </p><p> The blond man turned to her. "Beg your pardon?" he asked with a distinct English accent. </p><p> "The captain," she said. "Is he always so solemn?" </p><p> The transporter operator smiled a little sadly at her. "No," he told her. "Not always, Lieutenant." </p><p> Uhura glanced at the empty platform, as if something of Kirk remained there that might give her a clue about his demeanor. "He looked as if he had lost his best friend." </p><p> The blond man frowned at the remark. </p><p> "What did I say?" the communications officer asked, realizing she had hit some kind of nerve. </p><p> "As a matter of fact," the transporter operator explained solemnly, "the captain did lose his best friend." </p><p> By then, the yeoman and Lieutenant Bailey had joined Uhura at the control console. "Under what circumstances?" asked Bailey. </p><p> The blond man looked uncomfortable. "To tell you the truth, sir, I'm not really sure about that. No one is -- it's classified information. And the captain hasn't made any effort to fill us in. All he's said is that Lieutenant Mitchell died in the line of duty." </p><p> "In the line of duty," Rand echoed appraisingly. "I guess that's the way I'd want to go." She glanced at Uhura, then Bailey, and reddened a little. "I mean, if I had to go at all." </p><p> "One never knows when one's time is up," Bailey remarked soberly. </p><p> "That's true," the yeoman responded in the same theatrical tone of voice. "One never does." </p><p> But as she said it, she turned to Uhura and rolled her eyes. The communications officer had to suppress a laugh. </p><p> <i>Well,</i> she thought, more than a little relieved, <i>at least one person on this ship has a sense of humor.</i> </p><p><br> One moment, Kirk was standing on the <i>Enterprise's</i> transporter platform, gazing at Kyle and the three newcomers he had just greeted -- if it rightfully could have been called a greeting given the lack of warmth and enthusiasm he had demonstrated. </p><p> The next moment, the captain found himself on a considerably more spacious platform in the transporter room at Starfleet Headquarters. And it wasn't Kyle or Uhura or Rand or Bailey he was looking at. It was Leonard McCoy, hotshot research biologist at Starfleet Medical and, more importantly, one of Kirk's best friends. </p><p> "Jim," said McCoy, obviously torn between his happiness at seeing the captain and his sadness at the reason for it. </p><p> "Bones," Kirk replied, stepping down off the platform. </p><p> McCoy put a hand on the captain's shoulder and squeezed it affectionately. Then he glanced at Kirk's cast. "What happened to you?" </p><p> The captain shrugged. "I'll explain later." </p><p> His friend accepted the answer. "Come on," he said. "Let's get out of here, shall we?" </p><p> Kirk couldn't have been more surprised. "Get out...? But aren't you on duty?" he asked. </p><p> "To hell with duty," the doctor responded. Then he took his friend's arm and led him in the direction of the exit. </p><p> "To hell with duty?" Kirk echoed. He took a closer look at his friend's face, but the biologist didn't seem particularly upset by anything. "That doesn't sound like the Bones McCoy I knew on the <i>Constitution.</i> That Bones McCoy couldn't have been dragged out of his lab by a team of musclebound security officers." </p><p> The biologist harrumphed. "Well," he said, "may be I've learned a few things since I was that Bones McCoy." </p><p> "Such as?" the captain asked as they emerged from the transporter room and made their way down the corridor, passing headquarters personnel going in the other direction. </p><p> His friend shrugged. "Such as...you take from life what you can get, whenever you can get it. Because when it's over, it's over, and there are no second chances." </p><p> Kirk made another attempt to read the man's profile -- to no avail. "And...you came to that conclusion when your father died?" he guessed. </p><p> McCoy shook his head from side to side. "I came to it when you sent me the message about Gary. My father was an old man, at least, god rest his soul. He'd had a chance to live. By comparison, Gary was only a baby." </p><p> A baby who had seen the stars, the captain thought. But that didn't mean he didn't see the sense in what his friend was saying. </p><p> "So where are we going?" he asked, as they made a left turn down another corridor. </p><p> A smile tugged at the corners of McCoy's mouth. "A little hole in the wall I found after I moved back here. You're going to love it. It's called Velluto's and they make the best -- " </p><p> "Veal saltimboca?"

In One, Garth and his siblings make their way back to their cottage on a winding path as a storm approaches: "The piglets are marching four by four,/Alun is knocking on somebody's door,/And they all go marching/For to get out of the rain." Each page of text is headed by the number featured in the verse; in a nice touch, this number is echoed in a small illustrative detail, e.g., 2 berries or 4 flower pots, borrowed from the full-page illustration on the opposite page. In Ten, each pint-sized porker takes a turn tumbling off a high brick wall: "Ten pink piglets up on the wall/Ten pink piglets,/If one of those piglets should happen to fall,/Nine pink piglets up on the wall." Each number is highlighted in a large circle and illustrated by a double-page spread depicting the tottering piglets and a wolf's foiled attempts to snatch them. The last page shows that the youngsters have been jumping into the back of a large truck, which Mrs. Pig drives away just as the villain bounds toward them. The watercolor illustrations are full of action, expression, and witty detail. The melodies are included.

How will these changes impact the American criminal justice system? DEFENDING THE HOMELAND: DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND SECURITY is the only book that illustrates up-to-the minute information on how our criminal justice system has changed since 9/11. Written by an expert on academic leave to provide training for the Department of Defense, White provides an insider&#39;s look at issues related to restructuring of federal law enforcement and recent policy challenges. The book discusses the problem of bureaucracy, interaction between the law enforcement and intelligence communities, civil liberties, and theories of war and police work. From a practical perspective, the book examines offensive and defensive strategies. The book gives an introduction to violent international religious terrorism and an overview of domestic terrorist problems still facing law enforcement.</p><p>Jonathan R. White is professor of interdisciplinary studies in the Frederik Meijer Honors College of Grand Valley State University. The founding director of GVSU&#39;s School of Criminal Justice, Dr. White was promoted to dean of Social Sciences and served there until he was summoned to the Bureau of Justice Assistance to direct the State and Local Anti-Terrorism Training (SLATT) program after the attacks of 9-11. He conducted counterterrorism training for law enforcement and military forces in Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and throughout the United States. A recognized expert on religious terrorism, Dr. White currently teaches classes on national security, intelligence analysis, and counterterrorism in the Meijer Honors College.&#34;I&#39;ve only had this book for little over a week and I&#39;m simply astounded at the simplicity and truthfulness of the contents.

With a clear vision of this sweeping unity, we can then understand far better our own place within the storyline and our own personal role within the mission of God.</p><p><p>Stephen J. Binz is a biblical scholar, award-winning author, popular speaker, and pilgrimage guide. He studied Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome and Jerusalem and has developed dozens of books and programs in biblical theology and spirituality. A number of his commentaries are the foundation for the following Little Rock Scripture Study offerings: <i>Introduction to the Bible</i>, <i>Panorama of the Old Testament</i>, <i>Panorama of the New Testament</i>, <i>Exodus</i>, and <i>The Passion and Resurrection Narratives of Jesus</i>.

Binz lays out a solid survey of the New Testament. This book is recommended to parish libraries.<i>Catholic Library World</i><br><br>In his <i>Panorama of the Bible: New Testament</i>, Stephen Binz offers his readers two invaluable services: First, he succinctly gives us background information and content summaries of the books he discusses, thus enabling us to understand what the original inspired authors were teaching. In addition, he constantly reminds us that Scripture is a living word that is speaking to us in the context of our own lives. When we understand both the original revelation and the living word we can better realize that the story of God's salvation is not over; we are living out that story right now.Margaret Nutting Ralph PhD, is the author of seventeen books on Scripture, including <i>Breaking Open the Lectionary</i> for cycles A, B, and C<br><br>This slender volume by the well-known biblical writer Stephen Binz is aptly named a `Panorama' of the Bible. Its goal is to give the lay reader acquaintance with the overarching message of salvation that courses through the diverse books of the Bible.

Heath, 1991), carved out a significant niche in the advanced undergraduate market; it was intellectually serious and more up-to-date than its competitors, but also accessibly written. Its central thesis was that game theory allows us to understand many kinds of interactions between people, a point that Binmore amply demonstrated through a rich range of examples and applications. This replacement for the now out-of-date 1991 textbook retains the entertaining examples, but changes the organization to match how game theory courses are actually taught, making Playing for Real a more versatile text that almost all possible course designs will find easier to use, with less jumping about than before. In addition, the problem sections, already used as a reference by many teachers, have become even more clever and varied, without becoming too technical. <em>Playing for Real</em> will sell into advanced undergraduate courses in game theory, primarily those in economics, but also courses in the social sciences, and serve as a reference for economists.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ken Binmore</strong> is a mathematician-turned-economist who has devoted his life to the theory of games and its applications in economics, evolutionary biology, psychology, and moral philosophy.

But they are seldom clear what range of effects rhythm can reasonably be credited with, nor even, at times, what exactly the term refers to. Professor Harding here views these and allied problems from a psychological standpoint. Rhythm as a means of suggesting states of mind is discussed in the light of its being not merely something the reader listens to, but something he does, a system of movement. Throughout the book, the realities of spoken language take precedence of prosodic fictions, and emphasis is placed on the poet&#39;s organization of speech rhythms within a line of verse, metrical or free. Poetry and prose from the fifteenth to the twentieth century provide passages for illustration and analysis.</p><p>Critics take for granted the importance of rhythm in poetry and prose, above all its capacity for suggesting states of mind, especially emotional states.

But how did these politics first emerge? And what do they offer activists today, who seek to transform capitalist society at its very foundations? Maoism and the Chinese Revolution offers the novice reader a sweeping overview of five decades of Maoist revolutionary history. It covers the early years of the Chinese Communist Party, through decades of guerrilla warfare and rapid industrialization, to the massive upheavals of the Cultural Revolution. It traces the development of Mao Zedong&#x2019;s military and political strategy, philosophy, and statecraft amid the growing contradictions of the Chinese revolutionary project. All the while, it maintains a perspective sympathetic to the everyday workers and peasants who lived under the party regime, and who in some moments stood poised to make the revolution anew. From the ongoing &#x201c;people&#x2019;s wars&#x201d; in the Global South, to the radical lineages of many black, Latino, and Asian revolutionaries in the Global North, Maoist politics continue to resonate today.

Earthy, furious women. Angry, wistful men. Murderers, rapists, mothers, fathers, children, witnesses, redeemers. The poor, the abused, the displaced, the endangered, the dangerous, the depraved, the compassionate.

Could it be that Ai&#x2019;s experiences as a person of complex heritage (Japanese, African American, Choctow, Irish) inspired her to take on diverse personae? Born Florence Anthony in 1947, she changed her name to Ai, which means love in Japanese, and annealed love underpins her empathic, emphatic poems.

His major achievements--the <em>New Poems</em>, the <em>Sonnets to Orpheus</em>, and the incomparable <em>Duino Elegies</em>--had a powerful impact on European literature and have been the subject of intense scrutiny and increasing acclaim since the poet's death. Only in recent years, however, with the emergence of key documentary material, has it become possible to present the full story of Rilke's life. In <em>A Ringing Glass</em>, Donald Prater's aim is not to add to the preponderance of critical interpretations, but to provide a portrait of the man himself, and to show the background in which Rilke's extraordinary vision developed.<br> <br> And it is an extraordinary background. Rilke's nomadic existence led him from his birthplace in Prague through Germany, Russian, Spain, Italy, France, and finally Switzerland. He visited Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana, acted for a time as secretary to Rodin, and was a friend of Romain Rolland, Leonid Pasternak, and Walter Rathenau. He was the protege of Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis and the lover of Lou Andreas-Salome and Baladine Klossawska. Financially and emotionally, Rilke needed these associations; yet he dedicated himself fully to his art and remained single-minded in his search for the solitude it required. In his correspondence, from which Prater draws extensively, Rilke reveals the tragic conflict between his needs as a man and his goals as a poet.<br> <br> With this comprehensive biography, readers can delve deeply into the life Rilke built, a life as courageous and rare as the poetry it left behind.<br></p><p><br><strong>About the Author:</strong><br> Donald Prater is the author of <em>European of Yesterday</em>, a biography of Stefan Zweig, and his edition of the Rilke-Zweig correspondence will appear shortly in Germany.<br><br>"The reputation of Ranier Maria Rilke has enlarged enormously since his death 60 years ago: Even in the English-speaking world, he is now ranked, along with W.B. Yeats, as the major poet of the century....Donald Prater's new biography of Rilke--the most complete, detailed biography of Rilke ever written--underscores Rilke's uniqueness....<em>A Ringing Glass</em> is the best biographical account, so far, of a man determined to live on the loneliest outpost of the self and who brought back from there trophies for everyone."--<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em><p></p><br>"A major contribution to our understanding of the man who stands behind such extraordinary poetic achievements as the <em>New Poems</em> [and] <em>Sonnets to Orpheus</em>....[A] well-documented, eloquently written, and beautifully presented biography."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Donald Prater...seems truly alive to the time and place, the poet and his poetry....This book is intensely interesting and rewarding."--<em>Book Forum</em><p></p><br>"The book is filled with interesting details about Rilke....More importantly, however, Prater succeeds in capturing the euphoric moments as well as times of deep despair in Rilke's life, which greatly affected his artistic creativity and thus his works. The quotes, mostly taken from his letters, are well-chosen and well-translated by Prater....A valuable addition to Rilke scholarship."--<em>Southern Humanities Reviews</em><p></p><br>"A shrewd and authoritative biography."--<em>The Christian Science Monitor</em><p></p><br></p><h2>EVA: The Real Key to Creating Wealth</h2><p>Called "today's hottest financial idea and getting hotter" by fortune magazine, Economic Value Added (EVA) is the topic of conversation in financial circles around the world, from Germany and Japan to Singapore and South Africa. A revolutionary strategy for creating corporate and shareholder wealth that measures a company's real profitability, it has been adopted by such prominent corporations as Coca-Cola, Eli Lilly, and Siemens AG-with spectacular financial results. Yet, despite its increasing visibility, most executives still only have a vague notion of what EVA is and what it can do for their company. This groundbreaking book explains and clarifies all. Written by Al Ehrbar, a leading business journalist and senior vice president at EVA inventor Stern Stewart &amp; Co., EVA: The Real Key to Creating Wealth provides a complete, accessible overview that examines how exactly EVA works, how it is measured, what it can do to structure incentives for employees, and why it is as potent as it is.<br> <br> At its most basic, Economic Value Added is a measure of corporate performance that differs from most others by charging profit for the cost of all the capital a company employs, including equity. To help translate principle into real-world practice, Ehrbar presents revealing case histories of EVA success stories, including those of Briggs &amp; Stratton, the U.S. Postal Service, and Coca-Cola, which was catapulted from mediocrity to the number one wealth creator in the world with the addition of EVA.<br> <br> An in-depth look at a breakthrough idea whose impact is being felt from corporate boardrooms to Wall Street, this indispensable book is must reading for business leaders looking to fully grasp-and profit from-"the real key to creating wealth."</p><p>Al Ehrbar says there's a more meaningful way to gauge a company's performance than by quarterly earnings or other traditional yardsticks. It's called EVA, or economic value added, and it's helped turn companies like Coca-Cola into great engines of profit for shareholders. In <i>EVA: The Real Key to Creating Wealth,</i> Ehrbar describes how the formula works and how it can determine how efficient your company really is.<p> Unlike other financial ratios like EPS, or earnings per share, and ROE, or return on equity, EVA takes into account a critical factor: the cost of capital, or how much it costs to produce $1 in profit. Other measurements can be misleading because they show profits without deducting the price of producing them--a company that spends $1 to earn $1 could still appear profitable. As a result, Ehrbar says, those ratios can often show "accounting profits" rather than true profits as does EVA.</p><p> Ehrbar, a former editor and writer at such publications as <i>Fortune</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, builds a convincing case for EVA. Take Wal-Mart vs. Kmart in the 1980s, Ehrbar writes. By traditional accounting measures, Kmart appeared to be the more profitable company, with an average gross profit margin of about 29 percent, while Wal-Mart's was only about 23 percent. But over the decade, Kmart's market value plummeted and Wal-Mart's surged. "So why was Wal-Mart a winner and Kmart a loser? Because Wal-Mart was using its capital more efficiently," Ehrbar writes, with higher sales per square foot of space and lower inventory as percentage of sales than Kmart. While <i>EVA</i> is geared for corporate managers, investors also will find a comprehensive method for judging a company's value. <i>--Dan Ring</i></p>AL EHRBAR is a senior vice president at Stern Stewart &amp; Co.

A previously untold chapter in the history of World War II, this duplicitous activity is the gripping subject of <i>The Hunt for Nazi Spies</i>, a tautly narrated chronicle of the Vichy regime&#x2019;s attempts to maintain sovereignty while supporting its Nazi occupiers.<br><br>Simon Kitson informs this remarkable story with findings from his investigation&#x2014;the first by any historian&#x2014;of thousands of Vichy documents seized in turn by the Nazis and the Soviets and returned to France only in the 1990s. His pioneering detective work uncovers a puzzling paradox: a French government that was hunting down left-wing activists and supporters of Charles de Gaulle&#x2019;s Free French forces was also working to undermine the influence of German spies who were pursuing the same Gaullists and resisters. In light of this apparent contradiction, Kitson does not deny that Vichy France was committed to assisting the Nazi cause, but illuminates the complex agendas that characterized the collaboration and shows how it was possible to be both anti-German and anti-Gaullist. <br><br>Combining nuanced conclusions with dramatic accounts of the lives of spies on both sides, <i>The Hunt for Nazi Spies</i> adds an important new dimension to our understanding of the French predicament under German occupation and the shadowy world of World War II espionage.</p><p><b>Simon Kitson</b> is a senior lecturer in French studies at the University of Birmingham.

Kitson is the first person to have tested these accounts against the historical record deriving from the rich body of archives recently&nbsp;repatriated to France from the former Soviet Union. The result of that important original research, <i>The Hunt for Nazi Spies</i> is&nbsp;a distinguished and skillfully written work."</p> (Julian Jackson, author of France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944)<br><br>&#x201c;The story is at once&nbsp;confusing and fascinating. The Vichy regime tracked down left wing resistants&nbsp;and supporters of Charles de Gaulle's Free French forces. It deported slave&nbsp;workers and Jews to Germany. Yet concurrently, it tracked down and arrested&nbsp;hundreds of German agents who sought to further undermine France militarily. . . .

Goulden <i>Washington Times</i> 2008-02-24)<br><br>&#x201c;The important thing. . . is not these cloak-and-dagger adventures in themselves but what they meant. Simon Kitson's main achievement is to have put them carefully and sensibly into context. He presents Vichy's game convincingly as a complex pursuit of state interest somewhat refractory to our neat conceptual boxes labeled pro-Axis or pro-Allied.

It has been and will continue to be admired for these reasons alone. There is also much to interest the contemporary student of intelligence, particularly in Mr. Kitson's discussion of a counterintelligence bureaucracy 'weakened by puerile rivalries.' It may, however, be overlooked by readers of popular fiction. It shouldn't be. A reader willing mentally to supply just a few lines of dialogue here and there will find between the lines of this book a dark and cynical spy novel filled with all the wretchedness of human nature, one all the more disturbing for being true."</p> (Claire Berlinski <i>New York Sun</i> 2008-01-02)<br><br>"It is often said that the best things come in the smallest packages, and this could certainly be applied to this latest book by Simon Kitson. In less than 200 pages he has managed to contextualize and survey a little-known, but nonetheless important aspect of the history of Vichy France in a highly accessible and lucid way. . . .&nbsp;This book provides a fascinating insight into the shady world of wartime espionage that should be required reading for any serious student of Vichy France."

In short: The extraordinary exists if we know how to look at and think about it.</p><p><b>WHITLEY STRIEBER</b> is one of today's most influential and bestselling authors of both science fiction and extraordinary fact.

I asked him, "Are you like angels?" and he replied, &#x201c;Not as you have been taught.&#x201d;</i><br> An Anonymous Letter Writer in <i><b>The Communion Letters</b></i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> I am afraid of this book. There is something about it, something explosive and new. It is not a neutral book. It is an apocalypse of thought waiting for you, the reader, to actualize.<br> &nbsp;<br> The world will not really end as you turn these pages, of course. Not the real one anyway. Much might well be lost&#x2014;we hope. You should know that. But more, much more&#x2014;really everything&#x2014;might well be gained. In a few words, this is a book about a new world, the next world that has already arrived, that has always been here, whether we have recognized its presence or not.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the pages that follow, Whitley and I explore the proposal that we are all embedded in a much larger, fiercely alive and richly conscious reality that is only, at best, indirectly addressed by everything that the human species has ever thought or believed. The religions, for example, have been attempts to look at and engage this conscious reality as if it were primarily concerned with us, but we don&#x2019;t really know that, and in fact we cannot know that. Not at least yet.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our proposal? To venture outside the present houses of faith without forgetting those family homes or leaving the spirit behind. To embrace science in a new way, by promoting a more generous vision of the full human experience of reality that can embrace and ponder &#x201c;more stuff,&#x201d; especially the wild, fantastic stuff that shouts, glows, and zaps in these pages. And, above all, to understand, to <i>really </i>understand that we are already and always have been living in a super natural world, that we ourselves are highly evolved prisms or mediums of this super nature coming into consciousness, and that many of the things that we are constantly told are impossible are in fact not only possible but also the whispered secrets of what we are, where we are, and why we are here. This is a book about that Already World.<br> &nbsp;<br> To my knowledge, nothing like it has ever been attempted. Here, one of the most widely read figures in UFO and abduction literature and a seasoned (take that either way) professor of comparative religion sit down to encounter each other&#x2019;s thought&#x2014;seriously and respectfully. As the author of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most influential and intimate description of an abduction event, <i>Communion </i>(1987), Whitley sets on our shared table his visions of alien spectral figures that seemed at once physical and not physical, at once a thing and a thought, at once sexual and spiritual, at once traumatic and ecstatic. I bring the practices of the professional study of religion to the table in order to explain what historians of religion have written about these paradoxical things (it turns out, <i>a lot</i>) and how we might make sense of them without surrendering our critical faculties and understandable skepticism. We work in tandem. We read each other. We rewrite our chapters in the light of what the other has written. In the process, we rewrite ourselves.<br> 01<br> The text is at once intimate and professional, both in content and form. Whitley, far from being what he has been portrayed in the media&#x2014;that is, an advocate for belief in alien abduction&#x2014;reveals himself in his chapters as a questioning and self-critical nonreligious but spiritual man, telling his story as he has lived it, as a journey through unexplained but extremely powerful perceptions. I take the role of the trained comparativist, framing my responses to Whitley&#x2019;s narrative through the tools of my trade. I introduce technical terms. I use footnotes. I talk history. I play the professor. I demonstrate how the modern experience of the alien coming down from the sky <i>can </i>be compared to the ancient experience of the god descending from the heavens, but not in the ways that are commonly accepted today: &#x201c;Not as you have been taught,&#x201d; as the letter writer (and now you, as the reader of that letter) is telepathically told in our opening epigraph.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most of all, I engage Whitley&#x2019;s thought as an intuitive set of comparative and interpretive practices. I demonstrate how Whitley has, all along, been offering us a most radical theory of religion and the human spirit. I make explicit the principles that are implicit in his writing and give these the names and nuances that have been developed in the study of religion over the last two hundred years. Whitley in turn challenges me and, by extension, my field with experienced realities that few intellectuals are prepared to admit exist, much less are willing to study and try to understand: things like the imagination&#x2019;s ability to materialize its content in the physical environment, a home invasion and an implant, the human soul as a real form of energy that is not dependent on the body-brain for its existence, and an emergent mythology that is not entirely imaginary.<br> &nbsp;<br> As my initial invocation of an apocalypse of thought makes clear, neither of us takes this conversation lightly. Both of us have known professional rejection, religious hate campaigns, censorship, and outright character slander for what we have sincerely thought out loud in the public square. We know perfectly well that what we think cannot be slotted into the present order of scientific knowledge and religious belief. We will not pretend otherwise.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nevertheless, we want to speak clearly and respectfully to both the open-minded skeptic and the open-minded believer, as we think both have something important to bring to the table. And are we not all believers and skeptics at different moments? The final hope and intended result of this book is not yet another set of pat answers or clear conclusions about strange things. We have no such easy or settled answers. Our intentions for this book are more humble. We want to model a different sort of conversation about the importance of experienced anomalies, one that is more evenhanded, more careful, more intellectually generous, and so more useful.<br> &nbsp;<br> We want to shift the conversation.</p><h2>ASM Handbook Volume 1: Properties and Selection: Irons, Steels, and High-Performance Alloys (06181)</h2><p>A comprehensive guide to compositions, properties, performance, and selection of cast irons, carbon and low-alloy steels, tool steels, stainless steels, and superalloys. Contains 1,328 illustrations (photographs, charts, and graphs). More than 500 tables provide extensive data for alloy designations, compositions, and mechanical and physical properties.</p><p>Published: 1990Cast irons are described in six articles. The introductory article on Classification and Basic Metallurgy of Cast Irons was completely rewritten for the 10th Edition. The article on Compacted Graphite Iron is new to the Handbook. Both of these contributions were authored by D.M. Stefanescu (The University of Alabama), who served as Chairman of Volume 15, Casting, of the 9th Edition. The remaining four articles contain new information on materials (for example, austempered ductile iron) and testing (for example, dynamic tear testing).<br>Carbon and Low-Alloy Steels. Key additions to this section include articles that explain the relationships among processing (both melt and rolling processes), microstructures, and properties of steels. Of particular note is the article by G. Krauss (Colorado School of Mines) on pages 126 to 139 and the various articles on high-strength low-alloy steels. Other highlights include an extensive tabular compilation that cross-references SAE-AISI steels to their international counterparts (see the article Classification and Designation of Steels ) and an article on Bearing Steels that compares both case-hardened and through-hardened bearing materials.<br>Hardenability of Carbon and Low-Alloy Steels. Following articles that introduce H-steels and describe hardenability concepts, including test procedures to determine the hardening response of steels, a comprehensive collection of hardenability curves is presented. Both English and metric hardenability curves are provided for some 86 steels.<br>Fabrication Characteristics. Sheet formability, forgeability, machinability, and weldability are described next. The article on bulk formability, which emphasizes recent studies on HSLA forging steels, is new to the Handbook series. The material on weldability was completely rewritten and occupies nearly four times the space allotted in the 9th Edition.<br>Service Characteristics. The influence of various in-service environments on the properties of steels is one of the most widely studied subjects in metallurgy. Among the topics described in this section are elevated-temperature creep properties, low-temperature fracture toughness, fatigue properties, and impact toughness. A new article also describes the deleterious effect of neutron irradiation on alloy and stainless steels. Of critical importance to this section, however, is the definitive treatise on Embrittlement of Steels written by G.F. Vander Voort (Carpenter Technology Corporation). Featuring more than 75 graphs and 372 references, this 48-page article explores the causes and effects of both thermal and environmental degradation on a wide variety of steels. Compared with the 9th Edition on the same subject, this represents a nearly tenfold increase in coverage.<br>Specialty Steels and Heat-Resistant Alloys. Eleven articles on wrought, cast, and powder metallurgy materials for specialty and/or high-performance applications make up this section. Alloy development and selection criteria as related to corrosion-resistant and heat-resistant steels and superalloys are well documented. More than 100 pages are devoted to stainless steels, while three new articles have been written on superalloys including one on newly developed directionally solidified and single-crystal nickel-base alloys used for aerospace engine applications.<br>Special Engineering Topics. The final section examines two subjects that are becoming increasingly important to the engineering community: (1) the availability and supply of strategic materials, such as chromium and cobalt, used in stainless steel and superalloy production, and (2) the current efforts to recycle highly alloyed materials. Both of these subjects are new to the Handbook series. A second article on recycling of nonferrous alloys will be published in Volume 2 of the 10th Edition.</p><h2>The Jewish World Family Haggadah: With Photographs By Zion Ozeri</h2><p>World-famous photographer Zion Ozeri, a Manhattan resident raised in Israel, is acclaimed by organizations around the world for capturing, in some instances, the last Jewish communities in many countries, from India to Iran. He has traveled the world collecting these priceless cultural portraits of a people united by tradition. To illuminate the Haggadah, the annual retelling of the Jewish people&#39;s escape from Egypt, Ozeri&#39;s photographs are paired with modern text by noted Jewish scholar and Hagaddah expert, Shoshana Silberman, whose A Family Haggadah I and II (Karben) are widely used in Reform and Conservative Jewish family celebrations of Passover. This handsome, affordably priced Haggadah, in trade paperback, is the first of its kind to use photography to illustrate the annual book of prayers and traditions used in over 6,000,000 Jewish households across America each year. Each photo will be accompanied by a facing caption telling the land of origin of its subjects, from Argentina to Bukharin to the land of Israel.</p><p></p><h2>En Guerre: French Illustrators and World War I</h2><p>With 2014 marking the one-hundredth anniversary of the commencement of World War I, <i>En Guerre </i>offers a fresh, thought-provoking exploration of the impact of the Great War as viewed through the lens of French graphic illustration of the period. Published in conjunction with an exhibition of these illustrations at the University of Chicago Library&#x2019;s Special Collections Research Center, this catalog draws from illustrated books, magazines, and prints to present a wide range of perspectives on themes essential to a deeper understanding of the war in France: patriotism, nationalism, propaganda, and the soldier&#x2019;s experience, as well as the mobilization of the French national home front as seen through fashion, music, humor, and children&#x2019;s literature. With a text by noted historians Neil Harris and Teri J. Edelstein and featuring more than one hundred reproductions of the vivid and colorful work of French illustrators, <i>En Guerre</i> reaffirms the persuasive role that art can play in the service of political and military power.</p><p><b>Neil Harris</b> is the Preston and Sterling Morton Professor of History and Art History Emeritus at the University of Chicago.&nbsp;His books include <i>T</i><i>he Artist in American Society</i>; <i>Humbug: The Art of P.

But this newest edition adds some noteworthy extras: the unabridged text includes two chapters that don't appear in some modern versions ("The Pipers at the Gates of Dawn" and "Wayfarers All"), and the book closes with reproductions of two of Grahame's actual letters to his son Alistair ("My darling Mouse") in 1907, written on ornate, old-timey stationery from two Cornwall hotels and recounting one of Toad's first adventures (which Toad fans will recognize as the train-assisted escape of a certain "washerwoman").</p> <p> These inclusions alone might merit a new edition, but Foreman's illustrations stand shoulder to shoulder with those of previous <i>Winds</i> artists (among them Ernest Shepard, the original illustrator, and Arthur Rackham, both of whom Foreman modestly stands "in awe" of). The lively, full-color illustrations appear generously throughout the book, as they convincingly capture both the story's small moments (like the washerwoman's weeping, for one) and more explosive events (like the storming of Toad Hall).

Drawing on a decade of experience battling for freedom of speech on campus, First Amendment lawyer Greg Lukianoff reveals how higher education fails to teach students to become critical thinkers: by stifling open debate, our campuses are supercharging ideological divisions, promoting groupthink, and encouraging an unscholarly certainty about complex issues.<br><br>Lukianoff walks readers through the life of a modern-day college student, from orientation to the end of freshman year. Through this lens, he describes startling violations of free speech rights: a student in Indiana punished for publicly reading a book, a student in Georgia expelled for a pro-environment collage he posted on Facebook, students at Yale banned from putting an F. Scott Fitzgerald quote on a T shirt, and students across the country corralled into tiny free speech zones&#x201d; when they wanted to express their views.<br><br>But Lukianoff goes further, demonstrating how this culture of censorship is bleeding into the larger society. As he explores public controversies involving Juan Williams, Rush Limbaugh, Bill Maher, Richard Dawkins, Larry Summers even Dave Barry and Jon Stewart Lukianoff paints a stark picture of our ability as a nation to discuss important issues rationally. <i>Unlearning Liberty: Campus Censorship and the End of American Debate</i> illuminates how intolerance for dissent and debate on today&#x2019;s campus threatens the freedom of every citizen and makes us all just a little bit dumber.<br></p><p>Greg Lukianoff is an attorney and president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.

This compelling biography of the most powerful European monarch of his day begins with his conception (1526) and ends with his ascent to Paradise (1603), two occurrences surprisingly well documented by contemporaries. Eminent historian Geoffrey Parker draws on four decades of research on Philip as well as a recent, extraordinary archival discovery&#x2014;a trove of 3,000 documents in the vaults of the Hispanic Society of America in New York City, unread since crossing Philip&#x2019;s own desk more than four centuries ago.

The president, it <br>says, will be vested with "executive power," will be commander in chief of the <br>nation"s military forces, and will have the power to make treaties and appoint <br>judges and executive officers with the advice and consent of the Senate. "He <br>shall from time to time give to the Congress information on the State of the <br>Union" and recommend measures for the legislature"s consideration. The <br>president will receive ambassadors and will "take care that the Laws be <br>faithfully executed." Otherwise, the Framers had almost nothing to say about <br>what the president would do or what kind of person the president would be.<br> Through most of American history, however, the presidency has <br>been much more than a simple instrument of executive power. Presidents, far <br>from merely executing laws conceived and passed by others, have been the <br>source of some of the most important shifts in the nation"s public policy and <br>political ideology. They have played not only political, but social and cultural <br>roles in American life. They have experienced tremendous variations in their <br>power and prestige. The presidency has hidden its occupants behind a vast <br>screen of delegated powers and deliberate image-making. And the office has <br>been critically shaped not just by individuals but by powerful social, <br>economic, and cultural forces over which leaders have little or no control. <br>Characterizing the American presidency&#x2014;the task that this book has set for <br>itself&#x2014;is, as a result, very challenging.<br> We start by distinguishing the presidency from the presidents, the <br>office from those who held it. This book is not, then, a collection of <br>presidential biographies, although it provides much biographical information <br>about each of the forty-two men who have served as president. Rather, its <br>focus is how these individuals have perceived and used the office, and how <br>the office has changed as a result.<br> Since George Washington"s Inauguration in 1789, there have been <br>periods of greater and lesser change, of turbulence and calm, of advance and <br>retreat in the American presidency. Across these many years, however, four <br>broad themes stand out: the symbolic importance of the presidency, which <br>transcends its formal constitutional powers; the wide swings in its fortunes; <br>the influence wielded not only by the president but also by his advisers; and <br>the role of contingency and context in shaping the office and particular <br>presidencies.<br><br>Among the salient characteristics of the American presidency is that it has <br>usually played a role in American life that extends well beyond the formal <br>responsibilities of the office. Almost all presidents&#x2014;whatever they have or <br>have not achieved&#x2014;have occupied positions of enormous symbolic and <br>cultural importance in American life. They have become the secular icons of <br>the republic&#x2014;emblems of nationhood and embodiments of the values that <br>Americans have claimed to cherish.<br> Exaggerated images of the virtues (and occasionally the sins) of <br>American presidents have helped shape the nation"s picture of itself. Stories <br>of presidential childhoods and youths have become staples of popular culture <br>and instructional literature. Parson Weems"s early-nineteenth- century life of <br>Washington, with its invented stories of chopping down a cherry tree and <br>throwing a silver dollar across the river, contributed greatly to the early self-<br>image of the American nation. The popular Boys" Life of Theodore Roosevelt <br>influenced generations of young Americans and helped form twentieth-<br>century images of the presidency and of the nature of leadership.<br> Just as Americans have often exaggerated the virtues of their <br>presidents, so they have often exaggerated their flaws. Charges of <br>presidential misconduct and moral turpitude have repeatedly mesmerized the <br>nation for two centuries. The scandals that plagued Ulysses S. Grant, <br>Warren G. Harding, Richard M. Nixon, and Bill Clinton have molded both <br>scholarly and popular views of those presidencies. But these most famously <br>bedeviled presidencies are hardly alone. Thomas Jefferson, one of the most <br>revered of all Americans, was savagely attacked in his lifetime as a <br>revolutionary, a tyrant, and a miscegenist. John Adams and John Quincy <br>Adams, pillars of personal rectitude, were harried throughout their <br>presidencies by accusations of corruption, fraud, and abuses of power. <br>Rutherford B. Hayes, a paragon of propriety (and sobriety), was known during <br>his unhappy administration as "His Fraudulency" for having allegedly stolen <br>the 1876 election from Samuel Tilden. Harry Truman, a folk hero today for <br>what Americans like to remember as his plain-speaking honesty, was <br>buffeted for years by charges of "cronyism" and "corruption" &#x2014;for creating <br>what Richard Nixon and many others in 1952 liked to call the "mess in <br>Washington."<br> Almost everything a president does, in the end, seems to much of <br>the nation to be larger than life, even that least dignified of political activities: <br>running for office. During the first century of the American republic, most <br>Americans considered the presidency so august a position that candidates <br>for the office were expected not only to refrain from campaigning, but to <br>display no desire at all for the office. In reality, of course, most of those <br>seeking the presidency did a great deal to advance their own candidacies. In <br>public, however, they accepted their nominations and, if successful, their <br>elections as if they were gifts from the people. In the twentieth century, <br>campaigning for president became almost a full-time job, both before and <br>after election, and no one could hope to be elected in our time by pretending <br>to have no interest in the White House. But the perpetual campaigning has <br>given the presidency a different kind of symbolic importance; for presidents, <br>and presidential candidates, are now ubiquitous figures in our media culture, <br>their presumed personalities and their projected, carefully crafted images a <br>focus of almost obsessive attention and fascination.<br> The gap between the image and reality of the president and his <br>office has been enormous at some moments, relatively narrow at others, but <br>always there. The reality of George Washington"s life was for many years <br>almost completely replaced by the hagiographic myths created by Weems. <br>Abraham Lincoln, widely and justly regarded as America"s greatest <br>president, became soon after his death a kind of national saint, his actual <br>character as an intensely and brilliantly political man obscured behind <br>generations of paeans to his humility and strength&#x2014;by his law partner <br>William Herndon, by his White House aides John G. Nicolay and John Hay <br>(whose account occupied ten volumes), by the poet Carl Sandburg (who <br>limited his to three). Franklin Roosevelt, a wily figure whose evasiveness and <br>inconsistency infuriated even his closest allies, became and for generations <br>remained "Our Friend," the heroic battler against depression and tyranny. But <br>even less exalted figures have inspired their myths&#x2014;the aristocratic William <br>Henry Harrison portrayed as the simple product of a log cabin who liked hard <br>cider from a jug; the gruff, stubborn, and ultimately rather ineffectual Ulysses <br>S. Grant considered, for a time, a great and noble conciliator; the cool, <br>detached, intensely pragmatic John Kennedy, who became a symbol of <br>passionate idealism and commitment.<br><br>Another distinctive characteristic of the American presidency is the <br>tremendous variation in the fortunes of the office. At times it has been a <br>position of great power and enormous prestige&#x2014;an almost majestic office <br>whose occupant dominated and helped shape the public life of the age. At <br>other times it has been weak and relatively ineffectual. The number of issues <br>with which presidents must deal has, of course, continuously expanded as <br>the nation has grown larger, wealthier, more powerful, and more <br>interconnected with other nations and international institutions. But the ability <br>of presidents to deal effectively with those issues has ebbed and flowed. In <br>the early years of the republic, presidents had great influence over the <br>behavior of the relatively small federal government and were usually able to <br>win support for their goals from Congress. The three presidents who served <br>during the turbulent 1850s found themselves&#x2014;because of their own <br>limitations and the character of their time&#x2014;almost powerless in the face of an <br>increasingly assertive and fractious Congress. Lincoln seized wartime <br>authority that gave him unprecedented, many believed almost dictatorial, <br>power. Only a few years later, Andrew Johnson and Ulysses Grant found <br>themselves almost entirely subordinated to the will of Congress&#x2014;a situation <br>that continued through most of the rest of the nineteenth century.<br> The twentieth century witnessed a dramatic expansion of the <br>presidency"s importance and power, and also a significant growth in the <br>constraints facing individual presidents. In their relations with Congress, <br>twentieth-century presidents&#x2014;like their nineteenth-century counterparts &#x2014;<br>included men who have been both commanding and disastrously weak. <br>Social crises strengthened some presidents and weakened or destroyed <br>others. War and cold war exalted some presidents and brought others to <br>ruin. Some modern presidents&#x2014;Woodrow Wilson, Lyndon Johnson, Richard <br>Nixon&#x2014;experienced moments of towering achievement, only to suffer painful <br>defeats and humiliations soon after. Others, most notably Harry Truman, rose <br>from what seemed the ruins of their presidencies to political success and <br>historical regard. A few, like Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, <br>enjoyed cordial relations with the growing press corps in Washington, but <br>most of their fellow presidents found those relations contentious and difficult <br>to manage.<br> The president, the political scientist Clinton Rossiter wrote <br>exuberantly in 1956, is "a kind of magnificent lion, who can roam freely and <br>do great deeds so long as he does not try to break loose from his broad <br>reservation. . . . There is virtually no limit to what the president can do if he <br>does it for democratic ends and through democratic means." Rossiter"s view <br>fit comfortably into the exalted image of the presidency at the height of the <br>cold war. But a generation later, in 1980, Godfrey Hodgson, an astute British <br>observer of American life, offered a starkly different evaluation in a book <br>whose subtitle, The False Promise of the American Presidency, summarized <br>the prevailing assumptions of his time. "Never has one office had so much <br>power as the president of the United States possesses," he wrote. "Never <br>has so powerful a leader been so impotent to do what he wants to do, what <br>he is pledged to do, what he is expected to do, and what he knows he must <br>do." And yet, a year after Hodgson wrote, Ronald Reagan entered the White <br>House, reasserted the centrality and authority of the office, and changed the <br>image of the presidency once again.<br><br>It is not just the gap between image and reality that makes American <br>presidents elusive and intriguing figures. It is also the problem that both <br>contemporaries and historians experience in trying to separate the president <br>as a person from the things done in his name. Even in the nineteenth <br>century, when presidents worked with tiny staffs, wrote their own speeches, <br>and lived relatively openly, the president was never wholly master of his own <br>fate. His cabinet, his party, the party"s newspapers, and many others acted <br>at times under the authority of the presidency and created a haze over the <br>president"s own intentions and motives. Historians have often struggled to <br>separate George Washington"s own actions, desires, and achievements from <br>those of his powerful ally Alexander Hamilton. Andrew Jackson"s towering <br>image, during his lifetime and since, is the product not only of his own <br>imposing personality but of the actions of such powerful associates as John <br>Eaton, Roger Taney, Amos Kendall, and Martin Van Buren.<br> In the twentieth century, the president came to be served by a <br>vast and sprawling staff, presided over an even vaster and more sprawling <br>bureaucracy, and became subject to increasingly sophisticated methods for <br>shaping his image. And the biographers of modern presidents often find it <br>difficult to chronicle a subject"s life in the White House because the man <br>himself seems often to disappear into the sheer enormity of his office. <br>Changes in the once simple process of housing a president"s papers is one <br>indication of how the office has grown. The papers of every president until <br>Herbert Hoover are housed in relatively confined spaces in the Library of <br>Congress. The papers of every president beginning with Hoover are housed in <br>large presidential libraries, which are not just testimonies to the eagerness of <br>presidents to memorialize themselves, but also to the enormity of the records <br>of modern administrations. The paper trail of modern presidents is not a <br>result of presidents themselves writing more; in fact, most of them probably <br>write less than their nineteenth- century predecessors did. It is a result of the <br>steady increases in presidential staffs and the dispersion of presidential <br>power into many corners of government.<br> How can we separate those parts of the New Deal or wartime <br>leadership for which Franklin Roosevelt is himself responsible from those that <br>are the work of the large assemblage of talented, energetic, and ambitious <br>men and women who acted in his name? Did John Foster Dulles shape the <br>foreign policy of the Eisenhower years, as many people believed in the <br>1950s, or was Eisenhower himself at the center of the process, as some <br>historians have argued since? Was Ronald Reagan the bold and decisive <br>leader his admirers describe, or the passive, uninformed, detached president <br>that his critics&#x2014;and some of his closest associates &#x2014;have portrayed? There <br>are no simple answers to any of these questions because the modern <br>presidency is the creation of a single man and of many people whose actions <br>the president may never see.<br><br>Assessing the presidency is, finally, complicated by the difficulty of <br>evaluating the importance of political leadership in relation to other forces in <br>shaping historical events. This is a long-standing subject of debate among <br>historians and other scholars, but it is also a concrete historical problem. <br>Most historians would agree that events are seldom inevitable, that the <br>specific actions of individuals can affect, sometimes even fundamentally <br>shape, the course of history. But most historians today would also agree that <br>the decisions of individual leaders are not the only, and often far from the <br>most important, factors in explaining the past. Sometimes tiny contingencies <br>exert enormous effects, as did the butterfly ballots and hanging chads in the <br>2000 election. But time and again, large social, economic, cultural, and <br>demographic changes limit the options and overwhelm the assumptions of <br>leaders. American presidents are not only figures of power, therefore, but <br>also products&#x2014;sometimes as beneficiaries, ...</p><h2>The Mangle Street Murders: The Gower Street Detectives: Book 1 (Gower Street Detective Series)</h2><p><p><strong>The first in the charming, evocative, and sharply plotted Victorian crime series that is "a deft blend of accuracy and frivolity, sure to please lovers of historical mysteries."

The professions and trades during Hippocrates time are described as well as the early education of youth in ancient Greece. Medicines were not based on science but on driving evil spirits from the body. Hippocrates&#39; scientific approach to the study and treatment of disease has deservedly earned for him the title &#34;Father of Medicine&#34;. He was born on the island of Cos in 460 B.C., and his works remained for centuries the foundation of medical and biographical knowledge. In addition, it was Hippocrates&#39; daring approach to the problems of sickness and disease that drove the opening wedge into the wall of fear that surrounded human ills. Hippocrates&#39; scrupulous attention to professional ethics is honored even to this day by the medical oath that bears his name-&#34;The Hippocratic Oath&#34;.&#34;Desperate diseases need desperate remedies&#34; &#34;One man&#39;s meat is another man&#39;s poison&#34;-these well known sayings by Hippocrates were a direct attack on human suffering.

Also included are four of Whitman&#39;s superbly poetic essays, among them the landmark preface to the first edition of Leaves of Grass. Enhanced by treasures from the archives of the New York Public Library, including handwritten poems and letters and a stunning array of portraits and illustrations, this Collector&#39;s Edition allows readers a rare opportunity to experience the poet and his world.</p><p>One of the great innovative figures in American letters, Walt Whitman created a daringly new kind of poetry that became a major force in world literature. <i>Leaves Of Grass</i> is his one book. First published in 1855 with only twelve poems, it was greeted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as "the wonderful gift . . . the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." Over the course of Whitman's life, the book reappeared in many versions, expanded and transformed as the author's experiences and the nation's history changed and grew. Whitman's ambition was to creates something uniquely American. In that he succeeded. His poems have been woven into the very fabric of the American character. From his solemn masterpieces "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" and "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" to the joyous freedom of "Song of Myself," "I Sing the Body Electric," and "Song of the Open Road," Whitman's work lives on, an inspiration to the poets of later generations.The poetry of Walt Whitman is the cornerstone of modern American verse. He was America's first truly great poet and his influence is still evident today. The first edition of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass, published in 1855, was a revolutionary manifesto declaring America's independence from European cultural domination. His rhapsodic free verse broke radically with poetic, tradition: it was poetry about America, its democracy, its people, and its hopes. It was uniquely American without apology--brash, proud, optimistic, and filled with the bustling energy of the new and growing nation.<br>This collection brings together Whitman's greatest and most famous poems spanning the whole of his career. From the groundbreaking first edition of "Leaves of Grass are seven poems, including "Song of Myself" and "I Sing the Body Electric."<br>From later editions there are such masterpieces as "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking," and "I Hear America Singing." Also included is Whitman's great cycle of Civil War Poems, "Drum-Taps, which he wrote in the months when he was ministering to the wounded in battlefield hospitals. Concluding this collection is one of his last poems, "Good-bye My Fancy!"--his touching farewell to his muse, his life, and his readers.<br>More than one hundred years after his death, Walt Whitman's poetry has become part of the American heritage. It is a visionary which speaks as aptly to readers today as it will to future generations. As he says in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "others...look back on me because I look'd forward to them." Whitman's poetry is a link that connects all Americans--past, present, and future.<br>This book features a deluxe cover, ribbon marker, top stain, and decorative endpaper with a nameplate.</p><h2>Economic Analysis of Property Rights (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)</h2><p>In this text the author develops a theory of the costliness of transactions and then integrates this theory into a model of property rights. He demonstrates its utility by applying these models to problems that include rights formation, slavery and resource allocation in non-market settings.</p><p>This study offers a unified theoretical structure to analyze exchange, formation of economic rights, and organization. The cost of measuring accurately all assets&#39; attributes is prohibitive. Therefore, rights are never fully delineated and others (using theft, adverse selection, free riding, and shirking) may appropriate one&#39;s assets. The central question is how people allocate resources and organize their activities to maximize the value of their rights. The approach emphasizes non-market constraints, but is also applicable to market economies. It is useful for analyzing allocations within organizations as well as allocation by voting and charity.</p><h2>The Sacred Quest: An Invitation to the Study of Religion</h2><p>Taking a thematic and comparative approach, this book provides a clear, concise introduction to the study of religion.

Probability, Markov Chains, discrete time branching processes, population genetics, and birth and death chains. For biologists and other professionals who want a comprehensive, easy-to-follow introduction to stochastic formulation as it pertains to biology.</p><p><p> My goal in writing this book is to provide an introduction to the basic theory of stochastic processes and to some of the many biological applications of stochastic processes. The mathematical and biological background required is kept to a minimum so that the topics are accessible to students and scientists in biology, mathematics, and engineering. Many of the biological applications are from the areas of population dynamics and epidemiology due to personal preference and expertise and because these applications can be readily understood. </p> <p> </p><p> The topics in this book are covered in a one-semester graduate course offered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Texas Tech University. This book is intended for an introductory course in stochastic processes. The targeted audiences for this book are advanced undergraduate students and beginning graduate students in mathematics, statistics, biology, or engineering. The level of material in this book requires only a basic background in probability theory, linear algebra, and analysis. Measure theory is not required. Exercises at the end of each chapter help reinforce concepts discussed in each chapter. To better visualize and understand the dynamics of various stochastic processes, students are encouraged to use the MAT'LAB programs provided in the Appendices. These programs can be modified for other types of processes or adapted to other programming languages. In addition, research on current stochastic biological models in the literature can be assigned as individual or group research projects. </p> <p> The book is organized according to the following three types of stochastic processes: discrete time Markov chains, continuous time Markov chains and continuous time and state Markov processes. Because many biological phenomena can be modeled by one or more of these three modeling approaches, there may be different stochastic models for the same biological phenomena, e.g. logistic growth and epidemics. Biological applications are presented in each chapter. Some chapters and sections are devoted entirely to the discussion of biological applications and their analysis (e.g., Chapter 7). </p> <p> In Chapter 1, topics from probability theory are briefly reviewed which are particularly relevant to stochastic processes. In Chapters 2 and 3, the theory and biological applications of discrete time Markov chains are discussed, including the classical gambler's ruin problem, birth and death processes and epidemic processes. In Chapter 4, the topic of branching process is discussed, a discrete time Markov chain important to applications in biology and medicine. An application to an age-structured population is discussed in Chapter 4. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 present the theory and biological applications of continuous time Markov chains. Chapter 6 concentrates on birth and death processes and in Chapter 7 there are applications to epidemic, competition, predation and population genetics processes. The last chapter, Chapter 8, is a brief introduction to continuous time and continuous state, Markov processes; that is, diffusion processes and stochastic differential equations. Chapter 8 is a non-measure theoretic introduction to stochastic differential equations. These eight chapters can be covered in a one-semester course. One may be selective about the particular applications covered, particularly in Chapters 3, 7, and 8. In addition, Section 1.6 on the simple birth process and Section 2.10 on the random walk in two and three dimensions are optional. </p> <p> Numerous applications of stochastic processes important in areas outside of biology, including finance, economics, physics, chemistry, and engineering, can be found in the references. This book stresses biological applications and therefore, some topics in stochastic processes important to these other areas are omitted or discussed very briefly. For example, martingales are not discussed and queueing theory is only briefly discussed in Chapter 6. </p> <p> Throughout this book, the emphasis is placed on Markov processes due to their rich structure and the numerous biological models satisfying the Markov property. However, there are also many biological applications where the Markov restriction does not apply. A stochastic process is discussed in Section 7.2, which is a non-Markovian, age-dependent process belonging to a class of stochastic processes known as regenerative processes. It is important to note that in some applications the Markov restriction is not necessary, e.g., first passage time in Chapter 2 and the waiting time distribution in Chapter 5. This latter theory can be discussed in the more general context of renewal theory. </p> <p> In writing this book, I received much help and advice from colleagues and friends and I would like to acknowledge their contributions.

Like the doors of many professions, those of the theater world were shut to minorities for decades. While the Civil War may have freed the slaves, it was not until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s that the playing field began to level. In this remarkable book, theater producer and historian Stewart F. Lane uses words and pictures to capture this tumultuous century and to highlight the rocky road that black actors have travelled to reach recognition on the Great White Way.</p> <p>After the Civil War, the popularity of the minstrel shows grew by leaps and bounds throughout the country. African Americans were portrayed by whites, who would entertain audiences in black face. While the depiction of blacks was highly demeaning, it opened the door to African-American performers, and by the late 1800s, a number of them were playing to full houses. By the 1920s, the Jazz Age was in full swing, allowing black musicians and composers to reach wider audiences. And in the thirties, musicals such as George Gershwin&#x2019;s <i>Porgy and Bess </i>and<i> </i>Eubie Blake&#x2019;s<i> Swing It</i> opened the door a little wider.</p> <p>As the years passed, black performers continued to gain ground. In the 1940s, Broadway productions of <em>Cabin in the Sky,</em> <em>Carmen Jones,</em> and <em>St. Louis Woman enabled </em>African Americans to demonstrate a fuller range of talents, and Paul Robeson reached national prominence in his awarding-winning portrayal of Othello. By the 1950s and &#x2019;60s, more black actors&#x2015;including Ruby Dee, Ossie Davis, and Sidney Poitier&#x2015;had found their voices on stage, and black playwrights and directors had begun to make their marks.</p> <p><strong><i>Black Broadway</i></strong> provides an entertaining, poignant history of a Broadway of which few are aware. By focusing a spotlight on both performers long forgotten and on those whom we still hold dear, this unique book offers a story well worth telling.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><i>Stewart F.

Using money he had earned as a ship&#x2019;s steward, Brown founded the African Grove Theater, the first known theater established by and for African Americans in New York City. Finally, people of color were able to perform in plays of their own choosing. Finally, they were able to attend dramatic performances.</p> <p>Because of the intense racism of the time, the African Grove had to move frequently from one area of the city to another, and in 1923, it was forced to close. But an important first step had been taken. Black people had, for a brief time, taken the stage. Their history in the American theater had begun.</p> <p>Through text and photos, <strong><em>Black Broadway</em></strong> tells the story of the long road that people of color have taken from the first tentative productions at the African Grove to the grand stages of Broadway. Chapter 1 discusses the birth of American theater and examines how black people began to make their way in the field of entertainment. It looks at the era of the minstrel show, which, while demeaning to blacks, gave them the opportunity to ply their trade and develop their skills as performers. It also introduces the talented African-American composers, writers, and actors who produced the first black musicals to grace the stages of Manhattan.</p> <p>At the dawn of the twentieth century, New York City received a flood of southern blacks in search of greater social and economic equality. Although these immigrants did not find the equal opportunities they sought, they did discover a growing metropolis that boasted not only a newly established theater district but also a popular form of entertainment known as vaudeville. Chapter 2 first explores the important role that African-American entertainers played in vaudeville. It then looks at turn-of-the-century African-American musicals and shares the initial attempts made by the black community to produce drama that represented their experience in America.</p> <p>For most of the nation, the 1920s was a time of economic prosperity and high spirits. For African Americans, it also marked the birth of a social and artistic movement known as the Harlem Renaissance. Chapter 3 discusses this blossoming of black culture and looks at the groundbreaking dramas and musicals that enabled people of color to play their part on the Broadway stage during the Roaring Twenties.</p> <p>Although the Great Depression had a devastating effect on all aspects of American life, including entertainment, New York continued to offer productions throughout this bleak period of our history. Chapter 4 provides a window to the theater of the time. It looks at a number of significant dramas, including a captivating all-black production of Shakespeare&#x2019;s <em>Macbeth</em> that was funded by the Federal Government&#x2019;s Negro Theater Project. It also explores musicals that stirred controversy, inspired praise, and launched the careers of great black performers.</p> <p>By the 1950s, Americans had largely bounced back from both the Depression and World War II, and the country&#x2019;s rising spirits were reflected in its theater. Chapter 5 first presents an array of fabulous musicals performed by great African-American actors and actresses. It then looks at the dramas of the fifties, including a landmark production that not only dealt with serious racial issues but also demonstrated that plays written by black artists could captivate theatergoers of all races.</p> <p>Chapter 6 focuses on the turbulent sixties&#x2015;a time of enormous social change in America and tremendous experimentation in the world of the theater. Long-standing conventions were being questioned, old barriers were being torn down, and African-American performers were being featured in greater numbers than ever before. This chapter explores the noteworthy productions born of this unique period of history.</p> <p>Despite economic recession, the seventies and eighties would produce an astounding variety of musicals, including all-black revivals of traditionally white plays and revues that honored legendary African-American songwriters. Unfortunately, Broadway was far less hospitable to black dramas, but off-Broadway filled the gap, with the Public Theater and other venues offering opportunities to both black writers and black performers. This period also saw the emergence of August Wilson, an African-American playwright who would chronicle black history through a series of brilliant plays. In Chapter 7, you&#x2019;ll learn of both the struggles and the triumphs of these decades.</p> <p>The 1990s began with a much-needed revitalization of the theater district. Now theatergoers could better enjoy the fruits of Broadway, including a host of plays that featured African-American performers. As the nineties gave birth to a new millennium, a quiet revolution began to take place as African-American producers joined the theater community. Black playwrights, composers, and performers had been part of the Great White Way for many years, but black producers had been few and far between. As this began to change, new opportunities would arise for actors of color, and&#x2015;just as important&#x2015;African-American audiences would take an increasing interest in what Broadway had to offer.</p> <p>Change comes slowly and often painfully in any area of society. For two centuries, African Americans struggled to become part of Broadway, and while the fight continues, many battles have been won and significant changes have been made. It is my hope that <strong><em>Black Broadway</em></strong> serves as a guide to the many people who have blazed a trail to the Great White Way and made it more accessible to everyone&#x2015;black and white&#x2015;who seeks to entertain and enlighten us through the performing arts.</p></p><h2>Foundations of infinitesimal stochastic analysis (Studies in logic and the foundations of mathematics)</h2><p>This book gives a complete and elementary account of fundamental results on hyperfinite measures and their application to stochastic processes, including the *-finite Stieltjes sum approximation of martingale integrals.

This translation brings to the fore a more sharply engaged, comic and lucid Proust. IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME is one of the greatest, most entertaining reading experiences in any language. As the great story unfolds from its magical opening scenes to its devastating end, it is the Penguin Proust that makes Proust accessible to a new generation. Each book is translated by a different, superb translator working under the general editorship of Professor Christopher Prendergast, University of Cambridge.</p><p>"Time Regained, the final volume of "In Search of Lost Time, begins in the bleak and uncertain years of World War I. Years later, after the war's end, Proust's narrator returns to Paris and reflects on time, reality, jealousy, artistic creation, and the raw material of literature--his past life. This Modern Library edition also includes the indispensable "Guide to Proust, compiled by Terence Kilmartin and revised by Joanna Kilmartin. <br>For this authoritative English-language edition, D. J. Enright has revised the late Terence Kilmartin's acclaimed reworking of C. K. Scott Moncrieff's translation to take into account the new definitive French editions of "A la recherche du temps perdu (the final volume of these new editions was published by the Bibliotheque de la Pleiade in 1989).&#x201c;Proust is perhaps the last great historian of the loves.&#x201d; &#x2014;Edmund Wilson</p><h2>Pascalian Meditations</h2><p>A synthesis of forty years' work by France's leading sociologist, this book pushes the critique of scholarly reason to a new level. It is a brilliant example of Bourdieu's unique ability to link sociological theory, historical information, and philosophical thought. <i>Pascalian Meditations</i> makes explicit the presuppositions of a state of "scholasticism," a certain leisure liberated from the urgencies of the world. Philosophers, unwilling to engage these presuppositions in their practice, have brought them into the order of discourse, not so much to analyze them as to legitimate them. This situation is the primary systematic, epistemological, ethical, and aesthetic error that Bourdieu subjects to methodological critique. This critique of scholarly reason is carried out in the name of Pascal because he, too, pointed out the features of human existence that the scholastic outlook ignores: he was concerned with symbolic power; he refused the temptation of foundationalist thinking; he attended (without populist na�vet�) to "ordinary people"; and he was determined to seek the <i>raison d'�tre</i> of seemingly illogical behavior rather than condemning or mocking it. Through this critique, Bourdieu charts a negative philosophy that calls into question some of our most fundamental presuppositions, such as a "subject" who is free and self-aware. This philosophy, with its intellectual debt to such other "heretical" philosophers as Wittgenstein, Austin, Dewey, and Peirce, renews traditional questioning of the concepts of violence, power, time, history, the universal, and the purpose and direction of existence.</p><p>&#x201c;This book will surely endure a a major classic of late twentieth-century social theory.&#x201d;_&#x2014;Philosophy in Review<br>&#x201c;This latest book by France&#x2019;s preeminent sociologist provides a compact presentation of his concerns, methods, and leading concepts. . . . The book will be an excellent introduction to Bourdieu&#x2019;s fruitful thought for philosophers and social theorists.&#x201d;&#x2014;EthicsPierre Bourdieu is Professor of Sociology at the Coll�ge de France and Director of Studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales. Stanford University Press has published eleven other books by Bourdieu, most recently <i>The Weight of the World: Social Suffering in Contemporary Societies</i> (1999).</p><h2>Principles of Polymer Engineering</h2><p>The second edition of <em>Principles of Polymer Engineering</em> brings up-to-date coverage for undergraduates studying materials and polymer science.

The rest of the book concentrates on how these properties can be exploited to produce functional components within the constraints placed on them.

He was a powerfully influential philosopher as well, and is still considered, alongside Descartes and Spinoza, one of the great 17th-century rationalists. With no complete edition of his numerous writings on the wide range of subjects he expounded upon available even today, this 1920 collection of his early mathematical manuscripts-as well as some third-party commentary on them-continues to be essential to anyone wishing to understand Leibniz&#39;s contributions to modern science. Here students of the history of science and math lovers alike will enjoy Leibniz&#39;s thoughts on the infinitesimal calculus, including a series of manuscripts from 1675, 1676, and 1677, plus the essays &#34;Leibniz in London&#34; and &#34;Leibniz and Pascal&#34; by German scholar C.I.

Contending that humanists from Plato to Alan Bloom have identified excessively with the written word, Winn examines the troubled relations between the humanities and performance and calls for scholars to form a new alliance with performers.</p><p>In the four essays that constitute <i>The Pale of Words</i>, James Anderson Winn contends that literary scholars have systematically given short shrift to the performing arts. Winn, a professor of English as well as a concert flautist, is in the perfect position to offer such a critique. The essays, originally delivered as lectures, are pleasantly informal in tone without being breezy.<p> Starting with Homer, Winn documents the hostility toward performance shown by Plato, Augustine, Spenser, Milton, Dryden (to whom he devoted an earlier book, <i>John Dryden and His World</i>), Kant, and others. Rousseau's vehement denunciation of D'Alembert's proposal for a theater in Geneva is typical: "Like a servant dressed in his master's clothes," Winn explains, "the actor stands accused of 'forgetting his own place'; his trade is 'servile and base.'" But the virtuosity of Winn's historical discussion overshadows his subsequent exploration of "how the turn to theory might help us reconsider the troubled relations between the humanities and performance," which consists largely of predigested and uncritical exegeses of Saussure, Barthes, and Derrida. (Claude L�vi-Strauss, however, is instructively drubbed for his views on music, particularly his "nostalgic" acceptance of Western tonality as natural.) Overall, Winn's assurances that "theory" is the key to reconciling performance and the humanities are less than convincing. More convincing are the claims of the fourth essay, in which Winn proposes a reunion of the humanities and the performing arts--not merely through interdisciplinary studies but also through recognizing that scholarly excellence in teaching and writing requires proficiency in performing. <i>--Glenn Branch</i></p>Winn (English, Boston Univ.) closely analyzes the humanities, emphasizing their roots in performance traditions and their subsequent development. He concludes that music, visual arts, and theatrical display have been, over time, constrained by the written word and that, as a result, their essential nonverbal power has been undermined. Through musical examples and descriptions, literary quotations, philosophical discussion, and historical details, Winn offers persuasive evidence in support of his ideas. He draws examples from a variety of sources?from the structure of ancient Greek tragedy to the perceptions of jazz musicians to the writings of Roland Barthes, to name just a few. He uses his research brilliantly, coaxing out thought-provoking conclusions. Winn's final proposal, for collaboration between scholars in the humanities and performers, could be heeded with positive results, particularly given the state of the arts in contemporary society.

Some poets, such as Bei Dao and Mahmoud Darwish, are acclaimed worldwide, but many more will be new to the reader. The collection includes 400 unique voices&#x2015;political and apolitical, monastic and erotic&#x2015;that represent a wider artistic movement that challenges thousand-year-old traditions, broadening our notion of contemporary literature. Each section of the anthology&#x2015;organized by theme rather than by national affiliation&#x2015;is preceded by a personal essay from the editors that introduces the poetry and exhorts readers to examine their own identities in light of these powerful poems. In an age of violence and terrorism, often predicated by cultural ignorance, this anthology is a bold declaration of shared humanity and devotion to the transformative power of art.</p><p><p><strong>Tina Chang</strong> is the Poet Laureate of Brooklyn, New York, where she lives with her family.

Her most recent volume of poetry is <em>Blue Hour</em>.</p>Starred Review. This ambitious yet accessible gathering of hundreds of poets from various parts of Asia, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, America and elsewhere is likely to excite poetry fans as well as those new to poetry. Seeking a response to 9/11, the three editors, who are poets and teachers of Asian-American descent, hoped to share an alternate vision of the new century in which words, not weapons, could define our civilization. Divided into nine idiosyncratic sections&#x2014;with titles like Bowl of Air and Shivers that cover topics including Eros and the meeting of the political and the personal&#x2014;the book is more an esoteric journey than a systematic reference. Readers may recognize the names of major international figures (Nazim Hikmet, Taha Muhammad Ali) and famous American writers (Michael Ondaatje, Li-Young Lee), who may draw attention to many writers unknown in the U.S., such as Hsien Min Toh of Singapore, who, upon seeing sport hunters shooting crows, awakens to an all-too-familiar ambivalence about my unkind nation, in whose name only I will be/ able to walk up the lane with lowered head.

His &#34;socio-semiotics&#34; brings empirical study to postmodern theory in a way which both challenges the orthodoxies of academic postmodernism and offers a fresh new approach.</p><p>This book is the first systematic treatment of semiotics from the perspective of postmodernism. It not only develops an important theory of the role of symbols in postmodern culture but helps the reader to analyze contemporary society by providing a series of case studies that apply theory to everyday life. Chapters are devoted to applied studies of malls, Disneyland and theme parks, the role of signs and advertising in late capitalism, fashion, the body, rock subcultures, and the question of identity. <p>The relationship between semiotics and postmodern culture discussed in this book rejects the influence of Saussure and is based, instead on Peirce. It makes a contribution to Peircian semiotics and at the same time provides a critique of deconstruction and the cultural analysis of Baudrillard. In their place it proposes a materialist semiotics which avoids the idealism and the privileging of mental states by postmodernism. With these advances the book not only makes a substantive contribution to postmodern theory and cultural studies, but also shows the reader how to apply its insights to contemporary society.</p><b>Mark Gottdiener</b> is Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Riverside.

His life thus coincided with the flowering of the early Renaissance, and indeed his closest friend was Petrarch, the other towering literary figure of the period. During his lifetime, Boccaccio was a diplomat, businessman, and international traveler, as well as the creator of numerous works of prose and poetry. Of his achievements,&nbsp;<i>The Decameron</i>, completed sometime between 1350 and 1352, remains his lasting contribution to world literature, immensely popular from its original appearance to the present day.&nbsp;<b>Peter Hainsworth</b>&nbsp;(translator) is an emeritus fellow and professor of Italian at Oxford University.</p>&#x201c;The&nbsp;<i>Decameron,</i>&nbsp;by Giovanni Boccaccio (1313&#x2013;1375), made a great impression on me. . . . Ten youths&#x2014;seven&nbsp;women and three men&#x2014;take turns telling stories for 10 days. At around the age of 16, I found it reassuring that Boccaccio, in conceiving his narrators, had made most of them women.

There was something to hope for. . . .&nbsp;The seven female narrators of the&nbsp;<i>Decameron</i>&nbsp;should never again need to rely on the great Giovanni Boccaccio to express themselves. . . .

This is Kenneth Lapatin&#39;s startling conclusion in &#34;Mysteries of the Snake Goddess--a brilliant investigation into the true origins of the celebrated Bronze Age artifact, and into the fascinating world of archaeologists, adventurers, and artisans that converged in Crete at the turn of the twentieth century. Including characters from Sir Arthur Evans, legendary excavator of the Palace of Minos at Knossos, who was driven to discover a sophisticated early European civilization to rival that of the Orient, to his principal restorer Swiss painter Emil Gillieron, who out of handfuls of fragments fashioned a picture of Minoan life that conformed to contemporary taste, this is a riveting tale of archeological discovery.</p><p>In <i>Mysteries of the Snake Goddess</i>, Kenneth Lapatin traces the murky origins (and seriously debunks the authenticity of) "the most refined and precious" surviving object of Minoan art. The gold-and-ivory figure, now residing in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, was discovered in the early 20th century by renowned archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans. Other, related figures (of equally dubious origin) retain pride of place in several North American and European museums. They are almost certainly forgeries, according to Lapatin, or at best, "neither entirely genuine nor fully fake." This is not a crime story but rather a tale of well-meaning overextrapolation. Evans, and others, took kernels of evidence to bake a large loaf of an idealized, matriarchal Cretan civilization. In short, Evans's desire to believe clouded his scientific caution. As well, Lapatin gently points out that very often our re-creations of the past are influenced by the ideas, mores, and, even, inadequacies of our present. His book is one of calm, inviting erudition that, mercifully, avoids the mean wrangling so common in academia. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>Kenneth D. S.

After some years in private practice he left Germany in 1933 and, after a brief stay in Geneva, settled in London at the invitation of Ernest Jones. During the 1940s he began to formulate the principles and methods of Group Analysis and Group-Analytical Psychotherapy. In 1952, with others, he founded the Group Analytic Society, and was still actively involved with teaching, lecturing and participation in group seminars until the time of his death.Group analysis is a form of psychotherapy in small groups and also a method for studying groups and the behavior of human individuals in their social aspects.

Each major Chinese dynasty, Japanese Shogunate, or other discrete period is covered in a separate, brief chapter. Encounters with the West (beginning in the 16th century) are also extensively covered. In addition to Conrad Schirokauer, this text has three new co-authors. Miranda Brown teaches in the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and focuses on early Chinese culture. David Lurie researches the history of writing systems in Japan and also works on the cultural and intellectual history of Japan through the Heian period. Suzanne Gay is Professor of East Asian Studies at Oberlin College. Her research interests include the social and economic history of medieval Japan, with a particular emphasis on the role of commoners in history. This author team combines strong research with extensive classroom teaching experience to offer a clear, consistent, and highly readable text accessible to students with no previous knowledge of the history of China or Japan.</p><p>Conrad Schirokauer, Senior Scholar and Adjunct Professor at Columbia University and Professor Emeritus at the City University of New York, received his doctorate from Stanford. He has studied in Paris and conducted research in Japan and China. His published papers and articles deal mostly with Song intellectual history. He is co-editor, with Robert Hymes, of ORDERING THE WORLD: APPROACHES TO STATE AND SOCIETY IN SUNG DYNASTY CHINA (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993). His current research is on Song perceptions of and attitudes toward history. Schirokauer was associated with a New York University summer graduate program for teachers in Japan and China and remains interested in how history is taught and written. As a textbook author, he has published A BRIEF HISTORY OF CHINESE AND JAPANESE CIVILIZATIONS (Second Edition 1989), with separate volumes on China (1990) and Japan (1993), all now available from Wadsworth. Also worth mention, is his translation of CHINA&#39;S EXAMINATION HELL by Miyazaki Ichisada (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976,1981), which he recommends to any student who feels burdened by examinations.I.

His aim is to break down the division between the intellectual and the &#34;dirt&#34; archaeologist to demonstrate that in this discipline more than any other, theory must be related to practice to save effectively our rapidly diminishing heritage.</p><p></p><h2>Mouse Around</h2><p>A little mouse has a wonderful journey all around town when he falls from his nest into a plumber&#39;s back pocket.</p><p>There's plenty to discover and discuss in this carefully devised wordless story: A baby mouse, awakened by a dripping pipe, falls into the plumber's pocket to begin an adventurous journey that takes it out the door in the resident paperboy's doughnut and to various places around town before--having made numerous transfers (all unobserved by the humans) from one conveyance to another and survived dangers (including a cat and a garbage truck)--it serendipitously makes its way back, via an oblivious visitor's hat, to drop down the kitchen sink through the still-open-ended pipe, into its basement home. Using illustrations in round-cornered squares of various sizes to contrast scenes from the larger human perspective with smaller vignettes pinpointing the mouse's activities, Schories cleverly sequences her pictorial narrative, always focusing attention on what happens next. Her humans may be merely serviceable and her mouse more toy than live creature, but the astutely observed action here is consistently amusing and the overall design and organization are nicely harmonious. An unusually strong debut. (Picture book. 2-8) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>PreSchool-Grade 2-- Illustrations of varying sizes depict the wordless, inadvertent travels of a young mouse who falls from his safe nest in the cellar into a plumber's pocket. From there he journeys via doughnut, slipper, and toy truck (among other unorthodox methods) throughout a busy town. The trip is a circular one and he eventually returns home, although there is no indication that this is intentional. The many detours and adventures seem entirely random, which weakens the story's impact considerably. Schories injects some mild suspense as the mouse narrowly escapes various tragedies, but these do little to add depth. Because of their arbitrary nature, they indicate neither the mouse's bravery or intelligence, nor are they sufficiently exaggerated to create an atmosphere of slapstick humor. The illustrations are adequate, although the world they portray is decidedly bland. Those searching for a compelling plot or intriguing characterization will be disappointed by this slim adventure, but less demanding onlookers may find it diverting. --Lisa Dennis, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Child&#39;s Brain: Understanding How the Brain Works, Develops, and Changes During the Critical Stages of Childhood</h2><p>With <i>A Child&#x2019;s Brain</i> you can learn how a child&#x2019;s brain works, develops, and changes during the critical stages of childhood.

In this dark comedy, written around 1450, Alberti charts the lively fortunes of his anti-hero Momus, the unscrupulous and vitriolic god of criticism. Alberti deploys his singular erudition and wit to satirize subjects from court life and politics to philosophy and intellectuals, from grand architectural designs to human and divine folly. The possible contemporary resonance of Alberti's satire&#x2015;read variously as a humanist roman-�-clef and as a veiled mockery of the mid-Quattrocento papacy&#x2015;is among its most intriguing aspects. While his more famous books on architecture, painting, and family life have long been regarded as indispensable to a study of Renaissance culture, <i>Momus</i> has recently attracted increasing attention from scholars as a work anticipating the realism of Machiavelli and the satiric wit of Erasmus. This edition provides a new Latin text, the first to be based on the two earliest manuscripts, both corrected by Alberti himself, and includes the first full translation into English.</p><p><p>Sarah Knight is Professor of Renaissance Literature at the University of Leicester.</p><p>Virginia Brown is Senior Fellow, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, Toronto.</p>&#x201c;The sparkling translation, by Sarah Knight, frequently substitutes English colloquialisms for a more formal diction...The facing page's original text allows readers equipped with various levels of Latin--rusty or merely lightly oxidized--to follow the great success of the translator, who has produced a version at once faithful and spirited...There is a satirical violence of rhetoric here that goes beyond the familiar, and which makes <i>Momus</i> seem sometimes a premonitory text, looking forward not only to Rabelais and Erasmus, but to Swift and Beckett.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>James Wood</b><b>, </b><b><i>The New Republic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Momus</i> may reveal more about Alberti than any one of his other works, including his literary ambitions, his frustrations, and the labyrinthine courtly culture in which he made his versatile career. Best of all, this poisonously misogynistic text has been left to the ministrations of two women of formidable learning, Sarah Knight and Virginia Brown, whose competence systematically belies his withering pronouncements....<i>Momus</i> is an important, if elusive, work, now made accessible as never before in this splendid rendition.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ingrid Rowland</b><b>, </b><b><i>Bookforum</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An epic satire focused on the little-known classical god Momus, archetype of the critic and troublemaker, this work represents a notable contribution to neo-Latin satire in general and an eccentric addition to Alberti's corpus in particular...The appearance of an English version of Momus is a welcome complement to David Marsh's translations of two other Latin comic works by Alberti, the <i>Intercenales</i> (1987) and the <i>Aesopic Apologi</i> (2004)...The Latin text by Brown and Knight and the English translation by Knight have been expertly rendered...The translation is fluid, graceful, and appropriately colloquial at times; Alberti would be pleased with the deft capturing of his sometimes bawdy tone...Momus as faultfinder, would find little to complain about in Knight and Brown's fine edition of Alberti's strange satire.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>George W. McClure</b><b>, </b><b><i>H-Net Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The Loeb Classical Library...has been of incalculable benefit to generations of scholars...It seems certain that the I Tatti Renaissance Library will serve a similar purpose for Renaissance Latin texts, and that, in addition to its obvious academic value, it will facilitate a broadening base of participation in Renaissance Studies...These books are to be lauded not only for their principles of inclusivity and accessibility, and for their rigorous scholarship, but also for their look and feel.

Juxtaposing the original works alongside scholarly contributions by well-established and emerging scholars from several disciplines, <i>Mainframe Experimentalism</i> demonstrates that the radical and experimental aesthetics and political and cultural engagements of early digital art stand as precursors for the mobility among technological platforms, artistic forms, and social sites that has become commonplace today.<br><br></p><p>&#x201c;The computer may now be seen as a &#x2018;universal machine,&#x2019; but this has not always been the case.

The aims of the book are twofold: to deal directly with the challenge of how to define responsible drinking in the face of the world&#39;s many different drinking styles, and to portray the many ways in which people have thought about or used alcohol as an integral part of their culture</p><p>Americans have a long history of ambivalence about the role of alcohol in their society. This vacillation turned to mayhem in 1919, when the 18th Amendment to the Constitution (later repealed) introduced Prohibition, which banned the manufacture and sale of alcohol nationwide. Today in the United States, a person legally becomes an adult at the age of 18: he or she becomes a citizen who can vote, serve in the military, sign a contract, marry, buy a gun, or buy a pack of cigarettes, but who cannot buy a beer or a glass of wine. Out of this gloomy picture shines a bright light: Dwight Heath's eminently sensible, intelligent, and hopeful book, Drinking Occasions: Comparative Perspectives on Alcohol and Culture, in which he describes the variety and versatility of drinking in many other parts of the world. In contrast to the negative view of alcohol in the United States, the reader is treated to descriptions of relaxed and positive experiences of drinking. <p> We must keep in mind that any product can be misused, even water and oxygen. Some long-distance runners have collapsed and died from drinking too much water, and some physicians have unknowingly caused blindness in premature babies by pumping too much oxygen into their incubators. Heath's book gives us the opportunity to learn about the drinking experiences of cultures that enjoy the social and health benefits of alcohol while avoiding the pitfalls of misuse. Can Americans take some practical advice about drinking behavior from, for example, cultures across the Atlantic? I confess to having reservations about such a possibility, because the "virus" of Puritanism continues to infect the United States in many ways, especially in relation to pleasure. </p><p> Right now, the federal government is prescribing a "safe" formula for those who choose to drink: two drinks per day for a man and one drink per day for a woman. In some other cultures, Heath reports, it is customary during a meal to serve a different wine with each dish and then a liquor or brandy with dessert. He goes on to state that although a person "may consume six or more drinks in the course of a meal, it is rare that anyone shows any [untoward] effects from doing so." Moreover, people may "match specific beers with specific foods." Heath emphasizes that "expectation plays a major role in shaping the effects (or lack thereof) of ethanol on a person's awareness and behavior." In many parts of the world, "popular beliefs based on generations of experience and reinforced by folk proverbs hold that those who drink are more healthful and hardy than those who do not, and their offspring are also [healthful and hardy]." In addition, alcohol use is integrated with many other human activities and is not viewed as an isolated phenomenon. </p><p> Contrast that with advice given to the American people. Experts seem to have a license to extrapolate findings as cause, exaggerate the consequences of alcohol misuse, manipulate people with misleading statistics, and frighten women who are even thinking about becoming pregnant into refraining from imbibing alcohol. During an era when the Surgeon General and social scientists are telling Americans how to live by the use of correlation as cause, Heath warns us, "Don't confuse numbers with science, and don't interpret a lack of numbers as implying an absence of science." </p><p> After studying the use and abuse of alcohol for 47 years, I have concluded that personal and social responsibility, not the substance, is the issue. Alcohol should be viewed as an inert, inactive substance put in a bottle or can to be used for health and pleasure by reasonable people. </p><p> Absent from Heath's examination of alcohol is the complicated problem of the self-destructive impulses and behaviors we all have to a lesser or greater degree. As we read his carefully crafted book, we come to see that the use of alcohol reflects a society's circumstances, experiences, and values. There should be more emphasis on the person and the surroundings in which alcohol is consumed and less emphasis on alcohol itself. Drinking behavior varies widely -- socially, culturally, and personally. The journey through life consists not of simple yes-or-no decisions and good or bad choices but the assumption of personal responsibility for these choices and decisions. Heath unfolds the vagaries of the use of alcohol by exploring when, where, how, what, and why people drink or do not drink. Whether we like it or not, alcohol is woven into the fabric of our world. </p><p> The physical, psychological, and social benefits of alcohol are well established. Heath's book provides a well-documented glimpse into the use of alcohol in other cultures and reveals how the United States -- in purportedly trying to produce a good, by dictum and denial -- often ends up doing harm. </p><p> <i>Morris E.

This new volume, the latest in the widely acclaimed <em>Oxford Illustrated Histories</em> series, offers the most authoritative account of Irish history yet published for the general reader. Written by an expert team of scholars--all of whom are native to Ireland--this richly illustrated work takes us from the very earliest prehistoric communities and first Christian settlements, through centuries of turbulent change and creativity, to the present day.<br> Unlike earlier one-volume histories, which have tended toward oversimplification, this book emphasizes the paradoxes and ambiguities of Irish history, presenting a much more realistic picture. Why, for instance, are there such intense variations in agriculture, prosperity, and political affiliation in an island that compasses such a small area? And why do Victorian norms prevail in certain areas of 20th-century Irish life? In each chapter, the author marks new paths, redefining the preoccupations of the Irish and casting a cold eye on their ruling pieties. Overall unifying themes do, of course, emerge--and provide the familiar ground of Irish historiography: the shifting patterns of settlement and colonization, the recurrent religious strife, the establishment of new political entities.<br> The predominance of language in Irish life has led to the creation of a literature that is, in a way, a record of Irish history. A special feature of this book is a chapter that explores the interaction of Irish history and literature, what some have called "a bloody crossroads." The conflicts, settlements, discontinuities, and unities of Irish history are illustrated with a broad range of visuals covering the landscape, artefacts, architecture, and an enormous variety of contemporary material. There are over 200 photographs, including 24 full-color plates, and the volume is completed with reference material, maps, a chronology, lists of further reading, and a full index.<br> Wide-ranging, challenging, and highly readable, this vivid view of Irish history will instruct and entertain students, scholars, and general readers alike.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor</em>:<br><strong>R. F. Foster</strong>, Irish-born and educated, is currently Reader in History at Birkbeck College, the University of London.

The rationale of the book is that knowledge of the basic principles of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the lithosphere, the dynamics of the mantle, and the functioning of sediment routing systems provides a sound background for studying sedimentary basins, and is a pre-requisite for the exploitation of resources contained in their sedimentary rocks. The third edition incorporates new developments in the burgeoning field of basin analysis while retaining the successful structure and overall philosophy of the first two editions.</p> <p>The text is divided into 4 parts that establish the geodynamical environment for sedimentary basins and the physical state of the lithosphere, followed by a coverage of the mechanics of basin formation, an integrated analysis of the controls on the basin-fill and its burial and thermal history, and concludes with an application of basin analysis principles in petroleum play assessment, including a discussion of unconventional hydrocarbon plays. The text is richly supplemented by Appendices providing mathematical derivations of a wide range of processes affecting the formation of basins and their sedimentary fills. Many of these Appendices include practical exercises that give the reader hands-on experience of quantitative solutions to important basin analysis processes.</p> <p>Now in full colour and a larger format, this third edition is a comprehensive update and expansion of the previous editions, &nbsp;and represents a rigorous yet accessible guide to problem solving in this most integrative of geoscientific disciplines.</p> <p><b>Additional resources for this book can be found at:</b> <b>www.wiley.com/go/allen/basinanalysis</b>.</p></p><p><p><b>Philip Allen</b> graduated with a Bachelor&#x2019;s degree in Geology from the University of Wales, Aberystwyth and a PhD from Cambridge University.

The crisis is of long standing and its signs are widespread. Most proposals for improving management address one element of the crisis at the expense of the others. The principles described by award-winning author Stephen Denning simultaneously inspire high productivity, continuous innovation, deep job satisfaction and client delight. Denning puts forward a fundamentally different approach to management, with seven inter-locking principles of continuous innovation: focusing the entire organization on delighting clients; working in self-organizing teams; operating in client-driven iterations; delivering value to clients with each iteration; fostering radical transparency; nurturing continuous self-improvement and communicating interactively.

It's like having an extended conversation with Steve Denning, who is one of today's most acute and creative critics of traditional management thinking. You would ignore the ideas in this witty, candid, and erudite book at your own peril. Denning shows how to reinvent management based on a more accurate and effective understanding of how humans work best together. This book makes a great text for any extended discussion about how we should be doing things."<br> &#x2015;Laurence Prusak, author, Working Knowledge and What's the Big Idea?</p><p>"This is a book about a radically different way of managing. . . . It leads to workplaces that are more productive and more fun. These workplaces feel different."<br> --from the Introduction</p> <p>In this provocative book, Stephen Denning introduces the seven principles of radical management, along with more than seventy supporting practices. Radical management focuses the entire organization on the goal of constantly increasing the value of what it offers to its clients, not merely producing goods or services or making money for shareholders. The seven interlocking principles comprise a new mental model of management: focusing the entire organization on delighting clients; working in self-organizing teams; operating in short client-driven iterations; delivering value to clients with each iteration; fostering radical transparency; nurturing continuous self-improvement; and communicating interactively. The principles and practices simultaneously inspire high productivity, continuous innovation, and deep job satisfaction, and result in surpassing client expectations.</p> <p>Rather than offering a quick fix for today's complex workplace problems, radical management rethinks the nature and purpose of management. It addresses the questions: "What is good? Who is it good for? Is it good for the organization? Is it good for those doing the work? Is it good for those for whom the work is done? Is it good for society at large?" At the very foundation is open communication. Managers and workers must communicate interactively, using authentic narratives, open-ended questions, and deep listening, rather than treating people as things to be manipulated.</p> <p>The principles and practices outlined in this book create a work environment that lifts up the human spirit and inspires the exhilaration of extraordinary performance.</p></p><h2>Society and the Supernatural in Song China</h2><p><i>Society and the Supernatural in Song China</i> is at once a meticulous examination of spirit possession and exorcism in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and a social history of the full panoply of China's religious practices and practitioners at the moment when she was poised to dominate the world economy. Although the Song dynasty (960-1276) is often identified with the establishment of Confucian orthodoxy, Edward Davis demonstrates the renewed vitality of the dynasty's Taoist, Buddhist, and local religious traditions. He charts the rise of hundreds of new temple-cults and the lineages of clerical exorcists and vernacular priests; the increasingly competitive interaction among all practitioners of therapeutic ritual; and the wide social range of their patrons and clients.</p><p></p><h2>American Stories: A History of the United States, Volume 2 (3rd Edition)</h2><p><br> <i> </i><p> <b>Explore America&#x2019;s rich and complex past in this accessible presentation of American history</b> </p> <p> <br> Using a streamlined and powerful narrative, the authors take readers beyond an assortment of facts to tell the story of our nation. <i>American Stories </i>covers the essential elements and events in American history and uses significant incidents and episodes to reflect the dilemmas, choices, and decisions made by the American people as well as by their leaders. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> </p> <p>This title is available in a number of formats &#x2013; digital and print. &nbsp;Pearson offers its titles on the devices students love through Pearson&#x2019;s MyLab products, CourseSmart, Amazon, and more. &nbsp;To learn more about pricing options and customization, click the Choices tab. </p> <br> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>ALERT:&nbsp;</b>Before you purchase, check with your instructor or review your course syllabus to ensure that you&nbsp;<b>select the correct ISBN</b>.

The ineffectual International Criminal Court and its disastrous first prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, along with the failure in Syria of the Responsibility to Protect are the latest pieces of evidence not of transient misfortunes but of fatal structural defects in international humanism. Whether it is the increase in deadly attacks on aid workers, the torture and &#x2018;disappearing&#x2019; of al-Qaeda suspects by American officials, the flouting of international law by states such as Sri Lanka and Sudan, or the shambles of the Khmer Rouge tribunal in Phnom Penh, the prospect of one world under secular human rights law is receding. What seemed like a dawn is in fact a sunset. The foundations of universal liberal norms and global governance are crumbling."&#x2015;from <i>The Endtimes of Human Rights</i></p><p>In a book that is at once passionate and provocative, Stephen Hopgood argues, against the conventional wisdom, that the idea of universal human rights has become not only ill adapted to current realities but also overambitious and unresponsive. A shift in the global balance of power away from the United States further undermines the foundations on which the global human rights regime is based. American decline exposes the contradictions, hypocrisies and weaknesses behind the attempt to enforce this regime around the world and opens the way for resurgent religious and sovereign actors to challenge human rights.</p><p>Historically, Hopgood writes, universal humanist norms inspired a sense of secular religiosity among the new middle classes of a rapidly modernizing Europe. Human rights were the product of a particular worldview (Western European and Christian) and specific historical moments (humanitarianism in the nineteenth century, the aftermath of the Holocaust). They were an antidote to a troubling contradiction&#x2015;the coexistence of a belief in progress with horrifying violence and growing inequality. The obsolescence of that founding purpose in the modern globalized world has, Hopgood asserts, transformed the institutions created to perform it, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and recently the International Criminal Court, into self-perpetuating structures of intermittent power and authority that mask their lack of democratic legitimacy and systematic ineffectiveness. At their best, they provide relief in extraordinary situations of great distress; otherwise they are serving up a mixture of false hope and unaccountability sustained by "human rights" as a global brand. <i>The Endtimes of Human Rights</i> is sure to be controversial. Hopgood makes a plea for a new understanding of where hope lies for human rights, a plea that mourns the promise but rejects the reality of universalism in favor of a less predictable encounter with the diverse realities of today&#x2019;s multipolar world.</p></p><p><p>Stephen Hopgood is Professor of International Relations, SOAS, University of London. He is the author of <i>Keepers of the Flame: Understanding Amnesty International</i>, also from Cornell, and<i> American Foreign Environmental Policy and the Power of the State</i>.</p><p>"Hopgood's point of view, sure to be controversial, is argued with clarity, passion, and verve. Hopgood challenges those concerned with humanitarianism to look beyond Western-led human rights organizations, especially to activists working within their own communities, for hope. It seems certain that this book will cause both celebration and discomfort, even outrage, within the human rights community. Readers with an interest in human rights policy, humanitarianism, and even cultural history more broadly will find much to like in Hopgood's brisk, witty prose, even if they are discomfited by his arguments."</p> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"[R]eadable and brilliantly written, as well as... [rich] in information... and... controversial but challenging ideas."</p> (Pierre Hassner <i>Survival</i>)<br><br><p>"In this scathing indictment of the human rights movement, Stephen Hopgood contends that it has sold out its moral clarity for an alliance with interventionist liberal states.... Hopgood's provocation is powerful, and his privileging of locally and nationally inspired activism rings true. He does an excellent job of drawing together specific incidents to support his controversial views.... <i>The Endtimes of Human Rights</i> is a bracing alert for human rights professionals and all who care about global ethics. Scholars, practitioners, and NGO contributors will need to reckon with this important book."</p> (Clifford Bob <i>Ethics &amp; International Affairs</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>Christian Imperialism</i> is a very welcome addition to the field of both missionary history and the history of the early American republic... For historians of missionsit shows that Americans were deeply involved in global missionary work well before they had officially crafted an overseas empire. For scholars of the early American republicit challenges that customary periodization of empire and demands that we look both within and beyond borders to recognize that the American past was never exclusively American."</p> (Edward E. Andrews <i>Journal of Church and State</i>)<br><br><p>"According to Hopgood, we are witnessing the last gasp of human rights as the prospect of one world under secular human law is receding and thefoundations of universal liberal norms and global governance are crumbling (p. 1). It is from this vantage point that Stephen Hopgood launches into a nuanced and powerful demolition of the normalising metanarrative of the Human Rights agenda.... [T]his is a compelling text as Hopgood grapples with issues of 'who gets to decide global rules' and who gets to define "legitimate exceptions to them" (p. 2). Further, we see Human Rights are not, and never have been, above the fray of national sovereignty as organisations and states have always sought to set the parameters of the political sphere and define who would be excluded from the outset."</p> (Brian R. Gilbert <i>Critical Race and Whiteness Studies</i>)<br><br><p>"This is a provocative, angry book&#x2013;and an important one.... The book is particularly good on the link between human rights and liberalism, and how the larger the human rights non-governmental organization is, the greater the likelihood that it has been tamed by capital, existing to raise money rather than raising money to exist....

As the present book reveals, this enduring giant owes much to the remarkable men who shaped it. Throughout their long history the Mitsui family and executives of its enterprises have been innovators. This book perceptively traces the political and economic institutions that gave birth to Japan&#39;s merchants, nurtured her indutries and fostered her zaibatsu (the gigantic financial combines whose influence and power extended to every level of Japanese society. The entire history of one of the greatest zaibatu, Mitsui: its simple beginnings, its ever stronger ties with the government, its steady growth following the opening of Japan to the West, its increasing independence from family control and finally its phenomenal recovery following World War II is all captured in this book by John G. Roberts.</p><p></p><h2>Battles Of The Revolutionary War: 1775-1781</h2><p>The Americans did not simply outlast the British, nor was the war just a glorified guerrilla action with sporadic skirmishes. Americans won their independence on the battlefield by employing superior strategies, tactics, and leadership. So W. J. Wood contends in this groundbreaking study of the battles of Bunker Hill, Quebec, Trenton, Princeton, Saratoga, Cowpens, and others. For each engagement he describes the types of combatants on each side and the weapons available to them; outlines the tactics; narrates blow-by-blow accounts; and analyzes the factors that determined the character of the battle and outcome. <i>Battles of the Revolutionary War</i> has been designed for the "armchair strategist." Dozens of illustrations and maps, many specially prepared for this volume, contribute to the overall clarity and insight of Wood's presentation. Anyone with a desire to attain a feel for the dramatic times and colorful personalities that accompanied the birth of this country would do well to read it.</p><p>W. J. Wood (19171501997), was a retired Army lieutenant colonel whose background included not only professional authorship but also combat experience in World War II and the Korean war, a decade spent in professional war gaming for weapons systems analysis at the Army Material Command, and a lifetime studying military history. His books include <i>Battles of the Revolutionary War</i> and <i>Leaders and Battles</i> .The second and third volumes in "Major Battles &amp; Campaigns" are at opposite poles of the series format. D'Este, author of previous works on Overlord and Sicily, takes a strategic perspective, focussing on Anglo-American cooperation in the central Mediterranean. Wood's battle history of the American Revolution is tactically oriented. D'Este argues that the Allies and the Germans had essentially the same limited purpose: to keep maximum enemy forces pinned in a secondary theater. Neither of the principal Allied commanders, Harold Alexander and Mark Clark, had the character or the talent to make the Mediterranean theater more than a dead end. D'Este avoids discussing the campaign's grand strategic aspects and ignores British operations in the eastern Mediterranean. Nevertheless, his presentation is sound within its set limits. A paperback edition would be welcome collateral reading for courses in World War II. Specialists will find little new in Wood's pages, but troop movements and command decisions are presented well and perceptively critiqued. In arguing for the uniqueness of Revolutionary battles, Wood fails to delineate clear principles of selection. Neither political, strategic, nor institutional contexts are well developed. This is, however, a useful one-volume update of Christopher Ward's two-volume The War of the Revolution (LJ 9/1/52), the standard operational narrative. -- Dennis E.

Tell stories.&nbsp;This is the&nbsp;mantra of&nbsp;the Center for Digital Storytelling (CDS) in Berkeley California, which, since 1998 has worked with nearly 1,000 organizations around the world and trained more than 15,000 people in the art of digital storytelling. </p> <p>In this revised and updated edition of the CDS's popular guide to digital storytelling, co-founder Joe Lambert details the history and methods of digital storytelling practices. Using&nbsp;a "7 Steps"&nbsp;approach, Lambert helps storytellers identify the fundamentals of dynamic digital storytelling--from seeing the story, assembling it, and sharing it.&nbsp;As in the last edition, readers of the fourth edition will also find new explorations of the applications of digital storytelling and updated appendices that provide resources for budding digital storytellers, including information about past and present CDS-affiliated projects and place-based storytelling, a narrative-based approach to understanding experience and landscape. A companion website further brings the entire storytelling process to life.</p> <p>Over the years, the CDS's work has transformed the way that community activists, educators, health and human services agencies, business professionals, and artists think about story, media, culture, and the power of personal voice in creating change. For those who yearn to tell multimedia stories, <em>Digital Storytelling</em> is the place to begin.</p></p><p><p><strong>Joe Lambert</strong> founded the Center for Digital Storytelling (formerly the San Francisco Digital Media Center) in 1994, with his wife Nina Mullen and colleague Dana Atchley. Together they developed a unique computer training and arts program around the Digital Storytelling Workshop. This process grew out of Joe's long running collaboration with Dana on the solo theatrical multimedia work <i>Next Exit</i>. Since then, Joe and his organization have traveled the world to spread the practice of digital storytelling.</p></p><h2>Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt</h2><p>The <em> Encyclopedia</em> opens with a general map of the region and a chronology of periods and dynasties, providing a context for the entries. The first section of the volume then comprises 14 overviews which explore the history and significance of each period.<br>The main body of the text offers more than 300 alphabetically organized entries, written by some of the most eminent scholars in this field. Areas covered include:<br>artefacts - glass, jewellery, sculpture<br>archaeological practices - dating techniques, representational evidence, textual sources<br>biographies - Howard Carter, Gertrude Caton Thompson, Gaston Maspero<br>buildings - cult temples, private tombs, pyramid complexes <br>geographical features - agriculture, climate, irrigation<br>sites - Abydos, Dakhla Oasis, Thebes<br>social organization - kingship, law, taxation<br>The text is extensively illustrated with over 120 images. Each entry is followed by a selected further reading section which includes foreign language sources to supplement the available works in English.</p><p>Kathryn A. Bard is Associate Professor of Archaeology, Boston University, and is the editor of &#34;The Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt&#34; (1999). She has directed excavations in Egypt and northern Ethiopia since 1989 and was the recipient of the National Geographic Society&#39;s Committee for Research and Exploration Chairman&#39;s Award in 1998. Bard is Co-Director (with Rodolfo Fattovich) of excavations at the pharaonic seaport at Wadi/Mersa Gawasis, where in December 2004 they discovered the first pieces ever recovered from ancient Egyptian seagoing vessels, including riggings and cedar steering oars.Ever wondered what an <i>oxyrhynchus</i> is? Or why the Greeks gave that name to an Egyptian town? This is the encyclopedia to consult for scholarly information on ancient Egypt. Bard, an expert on the topic, has enlisted scholars from universities, museums, institutes, and research centers worldwide to produce more than 300 signed entries covering the Paleolithic era to the Arab invasion of Egypt in A.D. 639 . She and others wrote the introductory essays, which provide general overviews of the periods covered--Paleolithic, dynastic, six subsequent kingdoms, the Ptolemaic, and the Roman periods. A detailed chronology lists the numbered dynasties and the names of kings and queens who ruled during each period. Alphabetically arranged entries treat specific sites (<i>Karnak</i>), aspects of culture (<i>brewing and baking</i>), famous Egyptologists (<i>Breasted, James Henry</i>), structures (<i>Late Period private tombs</i>), other cultures (<i>Macedonians</i>), and themes (<i>anthropology and Egyptology</i>).<p>The work is especially strong on details of specific places, such as Abu Simbel. Coordinates are given in parentheses along with a description of where the site is, relative to such known landmarks as the Aswan Dam. Sites are listed by "most popular names." Floor plans and site maps accompany many articles. Most of the evidence for these sites comes from temples, tombs, and mortuaries because ancient settlements have become very difficult to find because of changes in the Nile River, dense population along the Nile, and other reasons, such as looting. A handy map in the front matter identifies the 103 sites treated. Metric measurements are used, and some Egyptian words are transliterated. For the uninitiated, a glossary helps identify terms used in the entries, such as <i>stela </i>and <i>wadi</i>. Brief bibliographies follow each entry, and the 43-page index is the best way to approach the volume.</p><p>This outstanding work is prepared by scholars for serious students of the archaeology of ancient Egypt. Egyptologists, philologists, historians, classicists, art historians, and anthropologically trained archaeologists helped write it. Margaret Bunson's <i>Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt </i>(Facts On File, 1991) is much more accessible and more reasonably priced for public, middle-school, high-school, and college undergraduate libraries. Her black-and-white illustrations are strong and definitions are brief and clear for term-paper purposes. There are entries for such familiar topics as <i>Nefertiti</i> and <i>Tuthmose</i> (spelling used by Bard), which are accessible in Bard only through the index as part of more complex, but thorough, discussions. Bard's work, however, is well worth the cost and belongs in all college and university libraries and other libraries supporting research in ancient archaeology. <i></i></p></p><h2>The Write-Brain Workbook Revised &amp; Expanded: 400 Exercises to Liberate Your Writing</h2><p><p>Banish the Blank Page with Hundreds of Unique Writing Exercises!</p><p>If you're battling writer's block, or if you're just looking for ways to flex your creative writing muscles, <i>The Write-Brain Workbook Revised &amp; Expanded</i> will ensure that you never face another wordless day.

Two folklore authorities provide reliable and often surprising answers to these and other curiosities that have shaped daily life in England for centuries. They explore the festivals and past celebrations of the English calendar, from St. Andrews Day and its tradition of drunkenness and cross-dressing to Twelfth Night and its king and queen cake. They also provide concise portraits of real and legendary characters that populate the public memory, including Robin Hood, The Brothers Grimm, Lady Godiva, Puck, and The Sandman. Fairies, mermaids, hobgoblins, and changelings are but a few of the supernatural forces surveyed here. However, as folklore encompasses the mundane as well as the fantastic, numerous other entries illuminate the significance of colors, numbers, flowers, animals, and household objects. Learn the curious history behind our distrust of the "black sheep," popular credence in "wishbone" wishes, folk cures for nosebleeds and warts, and persistent old wives' tales. In addition to ancient and medieval folklore, you will find many contemporary urban legends, e.g., the vanishing hitchhiker--a spooky figure seen ominously by travelers in Britain and the United States--and the Tooth Fairy. <br> An entertaining resource, <em>The Dictionary of English Folklore</em> will be a fascinating companion for readers of English literature, history, cultural studies, and fantasy.</p><p>If your hand itches, you're about to receive money. Walking under a ladder is not just unlucky, but might mean you'll never marry or are bound for the gallows. To get rid of mice, speak to them politely, suggesting another house they might prefer. Filled with fascinating bits of information, <i>A Dictionary of English Folklore</i> catalogues many of the tales and beliefs, ancient, medieval, and contemporary, in England. The term "folklore" may have been invented in 1848, but the stories and legends it encompasses reach far back into history.<p> Their intention, say authors Jacqueline Simpson and Steve Roud, "is to provide a work of reference, not to build theories--the entries therefore emphasize established dates and facts; speculative interpretations are kept to a minimum." Though dryly academic at times, the dictionary is a wealth of information on English folklore, of which little has been written (Scotland, Ireland, and Wales all have their own folklore and mythologies). Broader than just a collection of tales, the book includes important folklorists, holidays, numbers, plants, animals, and customs. Did you know "Goldilocks" was once "Silver-Hair" and before that an old woman? Or that folding your thumb into the palm of your hand and closing the fingers over it was believed to protect against witches? </p><p> Organized in alphabetical order with cross-referencing, the entries are thorough and well-cited (including books, publication dates, and page numbers). <i>A Dictionary of English Folklore</i> is a great reference tool for historians and folklorists, but also for those interested in the origins of fairy tales, old wives' tales, and superstitions. <i>--Dana Van Nest</i></p><br><strong>Dr. Jacqueline Simpson</strong> was president of the Folklore Society from 1993 to 1996, editor of <em>Folklore</em> from 1979 to 1993, and is currently Honorary Secretary of the Folklore Society.

Would you get relatively similar or completely diverse treatment approaches? In this remarkably unique book, Virginia Hunter does just that, presenting an analytic session she conducted with a borderline patient to eleven prestigious psychoanalysts. Then, taking this idea one step further, she delves into the individual histories of each of these master clinicians, exploring the close relationship between the clinical practice and theoretical foundations of psychoanalysis and the factors that influence it. <br>In provocative, compelling interviews, the clinicians talk candidly about their backgrounds, their personal myths and ideals, their cultural and educational experiences, and their encounters with social and analytic politics. Hunter demonstrates how these varied factors have influenced each analyst's choice of vocation, and contributed to the development of their theories of the mind, as well as their allegiance to the approaches they have adhered to throughout their professional careers. The book features in-depth discussions with such distinguished analysts as Andr� Green, Hanna Segal, Frances Tustin, John Bowlby, Ernest Wolf, Peter Giovacchini, Arnold Goldberg, Rudolf Ekstein, Robert Wallerstein, Arnold Modell and Jacob Arlow. By creating this unusual dialogue, Hunter illustrates how theories of psychoanalysis are constructed, sustained, and passed along throughout generations of analysts. In addition, she compiles these theories into a chart, and presents a clear and concise sample of the different psychoanalytic theories that underlie the statements and points of view of the eleven analysts consulted. <br>Providing a profound and enlightening journey into the minds of gifted analysts, and illustrating their differences in emphasis as well as the continuity in their approaches, <i>Psychoanalysts Talk</i> is important reading for any clinician practicing psychoanalysis. Similarly, this book is illuminating for lay readers interested in learning how varied theories of the mind may be useful in understanding a patient and conducting analysis. And finally, the book shows in an illuminating way how many creative possibilities exist in each analytic encounter. <br></p><p>Virginia Hunter, L.C.S.W., Ph.D., practices psychoanalysis and psychotherapy with individuals, couples, families, and groups in Long Beach, California. Her special clinical and research interests include learning difficulties, blocks to creativity, psychosomatic illness, depression, and anxiety.<br>"This...will undoubtedly be a valuable and essential part of the library of trainee, trainer and practitioner alike." --John Duncan in <i>Journal of Mental Health</i> <br><br>"Nearly all clinicians entertain the fantasy of presenting their most difficult case to a master clinician....Virginia Hunter's exposition is a realization of this daydream taken to unexpected and extraordinary ends. Over the course of 5 years, she met with eleven of the most esteemed psychoanalysts of the contemporary period to review one of her most challenging, recalcitrant psychoanalytic patients. Her interviews and case discussion with these individuals...are fascinating preambles to each analyst's fundamental theoretical concepts and ways of working with formidable clinical problems....This is one of those rare books that has something for everybody. For clinical homily, it is a gem. Look with each clinician's periscope, and your work is sure to improve. Do not expect theoretical obfuscation. The chapters are actual conversations and can be savored with a lemonade on a warm summer's day. By the same token, each contribution is substantial enough to inspire a range of reflections by the most discriminating reader...." --Kathryn J. Zerbe MD, The Menninger Clinic in <i>Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic</i> <br><br>"This original and creatively conceived book is a joy to read, to enjoy, and to reflect on...we must thank Dr. Hunter for her superb work. I plan to use this book, I hope, in a variety of teaching situations in the future..." --Dr. Roman N. Anshin,<i> Journal of American Academy of Psychoanalysis</i><br><br>"Eleven noted psychoanalysts talked and talked and talked to Virginia Hunter, a California psychoanalyst and psychotherapist who videorecorded their remarks and has now presented them verbatim in this unique and enriching volume....Hunter has given us a valuable resource for historians of contemporary psychoanalysis and a statement of the variegated psychoanalytic enterprise....More books like this are needed, but meanwhile we have Virginia Hunter's splendid contribution." --Joseph Reppen in <i>Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association</i> <br><br>"It was a joy to read a book on psychoanalysis written by an analyst so passionately involved with her craft. Dr. Hunter's heartfelt interviews, with 11 internationally prominent analysts, are fascinating and informative. These dialogues stimulated me to reflect upon how my personal history and transference to theory continue to influence my work with patients. There is a treasure chest of wisdom in this volume, from multiple theoretical perspectives, addressing controversial and crucial psychoanalytic issues. Any analyst or psychodynamic therapist will be enriched by immersion in Dr. Hunter's creative volume." --David M. Davis, M.D., University of California--Irvine<br><br>"<i>Psychoanalysts Talk</i> is unique, in that eleven well known psychoanalysts comment on the same session--thereby flushing from their theories a more precise sense of their individual visions of a patient--but it is a remarkable read because each analyst is skillfully interviewed by Virginia Hunter, who brings each of these interesting clinicians to life. They tell us of their childhoods and the trainings that led them to psychoanalysis. They discuss their analyses and their psychoanalytical educations with refreshing candor. Hunter's gift is 'lively interviewing' as she brings out the strengths and the weaknesses of each of her subjects, transforming these encounters into fascinating insights into the differing characters of those she meets. The book is remarkably informative and I cannot imagine psychoanalysts and psychotherapists without it. I am certain that it will become an invaluable resource for psychoanalytic education." --Christopher Bollas, Ph.D.<br><br>"Readers of <i>Psychoanalysts Talk</i> are in for a treat. Transcripts and discussions of in-depth interviews of eleven leading psychoanalytic thinkers, exploring their personal and professional backgrounds and their reactions to a case presented by Dr. Hunter, provide a fascinating view of the contemporary psychoanalytic landscape and a glimpse into the profoundly intersubjective nature of the psychoanalytic enterprise. This book will be of great interest to students and practitioners of psychoanalytic therapy." --Robert D.

Marieb,</b> taking the student&#x2019;s perspective into account has always been an integral part of her teaching style. Dr. Marieb began her teaching career at Springfield College, where she taught anatomy and physiology to physical education majors. She then joined the faculty of the Biological Science Division of Holyoke Community College in 1969 after receiving her Ph.D. in zoology from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. While teaching at Holyoke Community College, where many of her students were pursuing nursing degrees, she developed a desire to better understand the relationship between the scientific study of the human body and the clinical aspects of the nursing practice. To that end, while continuing to teach full time, Dr. Marieb pursued her nursing education, which culminated in a Master of Science degree with a clinical specialization in gerontology from the University of Massachusetts. It is this experience that has informed the development of the unique perspective and accessibility for which her publications are known.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>Dr. Marieb has partnered with Benjamin Cummings for over 30 years. Her first work was <i>Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology Laboratory Manual</i> (<i>Cat Version</i>), which came out in 1981. In the years since, several other lab manual versions and study guides, as well as the softcover <i>Essentials of Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology</i> textbook, have hit the campus bookstores. This textbook, now in its Ninth edition, made its appearance in 1989 and is the latest expression of her commitment to the needs of students studying human anatomy and physiology.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>Dr. Marieb has given generously to provide opportunities for students to further their education. She contributes to the New Directions, New Careers Program at Holyoke Community College by funding a staffed drop-in center and by providing several full-tuition scholarships each year for women who are returning to college after a hiatus or attending college for the first time and who would be unable to continue their studies without financial support. She funds the E. N. Marieb Science Research Awards at Mount Holyoke College, which promotes research by undergraduate science majors, and has underwritten renovation and updating of one of the biology labs in Clapp Laboratory at that college. Dr. Marieb also contributes to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst where she generously provided funding for reconstruction and instrumentation of a cutting-edge cytology research laboratory. Recognizing the severe national shortage of nursing faculty, she underwrites the Nursing Scholars of the Future Grant Program at the university.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>In 1994, Dr. Marieb received the Benefactor Award from the National Council for Resource Development, American Association of Community Colleges, which recognizes her ongoing sponsorship of student scholarships, faculty teaching awards, and other academic contributions to Holyoke Community College. In May 2000, the science building at Holyoke Community College was named in her honor.</p> <p>In January 2012, Florida Gulf Coast University named a new health professions facility &#x201c;Dr. Elaine Nicpon Marieb Hall.&#x201d; With the help of Dr. Marieb&#x2019;s generous donation, this facility contains laboratories in the School of Nursing that simulate an operating room, intensive-care unit, a labor and delivery room, and general medical surgical suites. She has also established a scholarship endowment for non-traditional students in the health professions, and an endowment to enhance the activities of faculty, students, and staff within health professions to support education, research, and community outreach. <br> </p> <p> <br> </p> <p>Dr. Marieb is an active member of the Human Anatomy and Physiology Society (HAPS) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).

Connella s ground--breaking text, which has become a classic work on the nature and construction of masculine identity. Connell argues that there is not one masculinity, but many different masculinities, each associated with different positions of power. In a world gender order that continues to privilege men over women, but also raises difficult issues for men and boys, his account is more pertinent than ever before. In a substantial new introduction and conclusion, Connell discusses the development of masculinity studies in the ten years since the booka s initial publication. He explores global gender relations, new theories, and practical uses of mascunlinity research. Looking to the future, his new concluding chapter addresses the politics of masculinities, and the implications of masculinity research for understanding current world issues. Against the backdrop of an increasingly divided world, dominated by neo--conservative politics, Connella s account highlights a series of compelling questions about the future of human society. This second edition of Connella s classic book will be essential reading for students taking courses on masculinities and gender studies, and will be of interest to students and scholars across the humanities and social sciences.</p><p>FROM THE PREVIOUS EDITION:<br><br>"Clearly written and sophisticated, this book presents Connell's ideas about males and the social phenomena that interact with gender." <i>Choice</i><br><br>"Connell&#x2019;s book is the fundamental study on masculinity as a formative factor on modern social inequality, and also of the most important books in the social sciences in recent years." <i>Journal for the Study of British Cultures</i><br><br>"A wonderful book; engagingly written, broadly researched, and politically useful. It is certainly one of the best of the recent, to use Connell's witty phrase, 'books about men.'" <i>Australian Journal of Political Science</i>&#34;Bob Connell is the most fertile, astute and influential analyst of the myriad and messy meanings of masculinities on the planet. &#34;The Men and the Boys boldly extends the scope, depth and power of the foundational work he laid in Masculinities to address the most urgent and difficult questions about global gender and injustice of our time.

The experienced birdwatcher, Edward Cronin writes in this friendly manual, is by contrast able to identify a dozen species in a few seconds, which compounds the beginner's lack of self-confidence. Never fear, Cronin reassures us: The "magician's trick of rapidly identifying species is, in truth, based on a logical procedure that anyone can master." One great secret, he goes on to say, is that most often a bird is what it appears to be: a pigeon is a pigeon, a duck a duck. Another great secret is to know that what is missing is often more important than what is there: a bird lacking a broad bill is unlikely to eat much fish and is therefore unlikely to be that duck. Cronin provides a well-structured set of lessons in how to apply these and other principles. The book closes with a sequence of checklists for the United States, broken into regions. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Gordon Morrison is a well-known naturalist whose work has been praised by Roger Tory Peterson as &#34;Marvelous, beautiful, excellent . . .

Every other passenger insists that the woman doesn't exist&#x2014;that she was never there at all. But as the train rattles on through Europe it becomes clear that something very sinister is at work.

For many others, he was the first modern dictator, a fanatic who instigated the murderous Reign of Terror in 1793&#x2013;94. This masterful biography combines new research into Robespierre's dramatic life with a deep understanding of society and the politics of the French Revolution to arrive at a fresh understanding of the man, his passions, and his tragic shortcomings.</p><p>Peter McPhee gives special attention to Robespierre's formative years and the development of an iron will in a frail boy conceived outside wedlock and on the margins of polite provincial society. Exploring how these experiences formed the young lawyer who arrived in Versailles in 1789, the author discovers not the cold, obsessive Robespierre of legend, but a man of passion with close but platonic friendships with women. Soon immersed in revolutionary conflict, he suffered increasingly lengthy periods of nervous collapse correlating with moments of political crisis, yet Robespierre was tragically unable to step away from the crushing burdens of leadership. Did his ruthless, uncompromising exercise of power reflect a descent into madness in his final year of life? McPhee reevaluates the ideology and reality of "the Terror," what Robespierre intended, and whether it represented an abandonment or a reversal of his early liberalism and sense of justice.</p></p><p><b>Peter McPhee</b> is a professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne. He lives in Abbottsford, Australia."Peter McPhee seeks to get under the skin and into the mind of Robespierre, juxtaposing personal and political factors in a gripping narrative. Robespierre emerges less as the man who ruined the Revolution than as a man the Revolution ruined&#x2014;by the time of&nbsp;his death in 1794 he was an ailing exhausted husk very different from the bright-eyed, committed and courageous politician of 1789.

Peter McPhee&#x2019;s lifetime of research on the French Revolution draws out the context within which Robespierre&#x2019;s words and actions can be better understood, and his insights into Robespierre&#x2019;s youth, and the way he changed, displays a real understanding of Robespierre&#x2019;s psychology.

In CHEMISTRY: AN ATOMS FIRST APPROACH, the Zumdahls use a meaningful approach that begins with the atom and proceeds through the concept of molecules, structure, and bonding, to more complex materials and their properties. This approach encourages readers to focus on conceptual learning early in the course, rather than relying on memorization and a &#34;plug and chug&#34; method of problem solving that even the best learners can fall back on when confronted with familiar material.

A spider lassoes its prey. A beetle persuades a bee to care for its young. This beautifully illustrated book by veteran naturalist Sir David Attenborough offers a rare glimpse into the secret life of invertebrates, the world's tiniest--and most fascinating--creatures.</p><br><p> Small by virtue of their lack of backbones, this group of living things plays a surprisingly large role in the evolutionary cycle. These diverse creatures (more than one million species are believed to exist) roamed the earth before us and will still be here when we have gone. They are the pollinators, cleaners, and recyclers of life on earth. Without them, we would not last long.</p><br><p> Attenborough has studied and enjoyed these diminutive beings since he was a schoolboy in the Leicestershire countryside of England. <i>Life in the Undergrowth</i>, part of his innovative series on natural history topics, looks at invertebrates the world over: their arrival on land and mastery of every habitat, and their fantastic variety of hunting, mating, and highly organized social behaviors.</p><br><p> Adults are prejudiced against insects--handicapped by their ignorance and fears and limited by their size and vision. Children, who are closer to insects in size, notice and enjoy the tiny creatures.</p><br><p> In this companion book to the Animal Planet television program, Attenborough shares his childlike curiosity for invertebrates, taking us down wormholes and into insect homes for an up-close-and-personal look at their habitats. As the biblical book of Proverbs implores: "Go to the ant, thou sluggard: consider her ways and be wise." David Attenborough does go. It is worth going with him.</p></p><p><p>"In <i>Life in the Undergrowth</i>, Sir David Attenborough again makes the difficult seem effortless--he delivers with characteristic grace and informality intimate details of the lives of creatures that often pass without notice, and yet on whom the functioning of this biological planet rests. I believe this to be the very best in his series--the sense of breathless wonder in his subject is palpable--and it joins the classic collections of nature essays by E. O.

In 1967, he envisioned and designed&nbsp;the Poor People&#x2019;s Campaign, an interracial effort that was carried out after his death.&nbsp;This campaign brought together impoverished Americans of all races to demand better wages, better jobs, better homes, and better education.&nbsp;<i>King and the Other America</i> explores this overlooked and obscured episode of the late civil rights movement,&nbsp;deepening our understanding of King&#x2019;s commitment to social justice and also of the long-term trajectory of the civil rights movement.<br><br> Digging into earlier radical arguments about economic inequality across America, which King drew on throughout his entire political and religious life, Sylvie Laurent argues that the Poor People&#x2019;s Campaign was the logical culmination of King&#x2019;s influences and ideas, which have had lasting impact on young activists and the public.

Why do we find it difficult to comprehend viewpoints that differ from our own? What are the inner foundations of our knowledge? In these concentrated and aphoristic lectures, Steiner speaks of twelve main philosophical standpoints, and the importance of understanding each of them. An appreciation of the variety of possible worldviews not only sharpens and makes more flexible our own powers of thinking, but also helps us to overcome a narrow-minded one-sidedness, promoting tolerance of other people and their opinions. Steiner goes on to explain how each standpoint is also colored by a particular &#x201c;soul mood&#x201d; that influences the way we pursue knowledge. Several philosophers and their works are characterized in this way, shedding light on their contributions to human culture. Through such insight into the true nature of human thinking, we are led to understand the quality of cosmic thought and how, in Steiner&#x2019;s words, people can be seen as a thought that is thought by the cosmic hierarchies.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>MBA Fundamentals Statistics</h2><p>In the <i>Kaplan MBA Fundamentals</i> series, real-world statistics basics that can be&nbsp;applied today<p>In <i>MBA Fundamentals in Statistics</i>, readers learn to decipher and critically examine the information that is presented to them on a daily basis through polls, surveys, scientific studies, and more.

Panels of scientific, medical, and engineering experts evaluate the safety of the food we eat, the drugs we take, and the cars we drive. But despite the enormous influence of science advice, its authority is often problematic, and struggles over expert advice are thus a crucial aspect of contemporary politics. <i>Science on Stage</i> is a theoretically informed and empirically grounded study of the social process through which the credibility of expert advice is produced, challenged, and sustained.</p> <p>Building on the sociology of Erving Goffman, the author analyzes science advice as a form of performance, examining how advisory bodies work to bring authoritative advice to the public stage. From this perspective, advisory bodies emerge as performers who engage in impression management: they selectively reveal and conceal themselves, actively presenting some things to their audiences while hiding others "backstage."</p> <p>The book demonstrates that techniques for information control&#x2015;including stagecraft, strategic self-presentation, and unauthorized disclosures or "leaks"&#x2015;play a fundamental role in efforts to create and contest expert authority. The author uncovers this complex assemblage of dramaturgical machinery through a richly detailed comparative analysis of three controversial reports on diet and health, including a proposed revision to the Recommended Daily Allowances, prepared by the National Academy of Sciences&#x2015;the most prestigious source of expert advice in the United States today.</p> <p>This lively and accessible analysis&#x2015;which includes its own drama, complete with Greek chorus&#x2015;provides not only new insights about science advice but also a fresh look at the social dimensions of scientific writing. The theatrical metaphor highlights issues that more familiar theoretical frameworks often leave waiting in the wings. In the author's hands, scientific texts emerge not just as rhetorical constructions or forms of discourse, but also as crucial parts of systems for controlling the enclosure and disclosure of information, and thereby for structuring relations between experts and their audiences.</p></p><p>&#x201c;A useful contribution to discussions of methodologies for examining the role of scientific experts in public policy debates.&#x201d;&#x2014;New Genetics and SocietyStephen Hilgartner is Assistant Professor in the Department of Science and Technology Studies at Cornell University.</p><h2>Functional Neurorehabilitation Through the Life Span</h2><p><p>Designed for physical therapist assistant students and anyone working in the rehabilitation of patients with neurologic damage, this easy-to-use textbook focuses on the framework for neurorehabilitative patient treatment.

From St. Louis, the lieutenant's modest party traveled across the Great Plains to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. Throughout the journey, Pike maintained a journal, describing terrain, Indians, hardships, and the group's daily activities.

In this groundbreaking book, Nancy Leveson proposes a new approach to safety -- more suited to today's complex, sociotechnical, software-intensive world -- based on modern systems thinking and systems theory. Revisiting and updating ideas pioneered by 1950s aerospace engineers in their System Safety concept, and testing her new model extensively on real-world examples, Leveson has created a new approach to safety that is more effective, less expensive, and easier to use than current techniques.</p><p>Arguing that traditional models of causality are inadequate, Leveson presents a new, extended model of causation (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes, or STAMP), then then shows how the new model can be used to create techniques for system safety engineering, including accident analysis, hazard analysis, system design, safety in operations, and management of safety-critical systems. She applies the new techniques to real-world events including the friendly-fire loss of a U.S. Blackhawk helicopter in the first Gulf War; the Vioxx recall; the U.S. Navy SUBSAFE program; and the bacterial contamination of a public water supply in a Canadian town. Leveson's approach is relevant even beyond safety engineering, offering techniques for "reengineering" any large sociotechnical system to improve safety and manage risk.</p></p><p><p>Nancy G. Leveson is Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Engineering Systems at MIT. An acknowledged leader in the field of safety engineering, she has worked to improve safety in nearly every industry over the past thirty years.</p></p><h2>The Uncollected Stories of William Faulkner</h2><p>This invaluable volume contains some of the greatest short fiction by a writer who defined the course of American literature.

What&#x2019;s the story behind these books?</b> <br> Wiley Publishing is releasing three new books of mine, <i>Creative Close-Ups: Digital Photography Tips &amp; Techniques</i> , <i>Creative Night: Digital Photography Tips &amp; Techniques</i> , and <i>Creative Composition: Digital Photography Tips &amp; Techniques</i> . My idea with these books was to help people become better photographers by presenting the subject of digital photography in a different way. <p></p> <p></p> <b>What&#x2019;s different about your approach?</b> <br> They say that cameras don&#x2019;t take photos, people do. It&#x2019;s really true. Someone with a great eye can take masterful photos with an inexpensive camera. Therefore, it is important to know something about photo technique, but the really amazing thing is that we can conceptualize and come up with these bits and bytes that make up a photo&#x2014;and they can be meaningful to people. I try to help people come up with images that are relevant and meaningful. Cameras and hardware are just tools. <p></p> <b>What&#x2019;s with all the photos in these books?</b> <br> Well, everyone likes to look at striking images, so one thing my photos do in these books is get people&#x2019;s attention. However, the photos play another role as well. Each photo in my book is accompanied by the story of how the photo was made and the technical data related to the photo. That way, if you&#x2019;re not ready to dive into the text itself, you can learn a lot just by browsing the photos. <p></p> My feeling is that you truly do learn about photography by looking at photos. It&#x2019;s much more important to look at images you admire and try and figure out why you like them than it is to read about photography. The photos in these books are baked into the DNA of the teaching strategy. By browsing through the pages, someone can learn a great deal and have an enjoyable visual experience at the same time. <p></p> <b>What&#x2019;s the most important thing that readers can get out of your new books?</b> <br> I want to inspire readers to be the most creative and best photographers they can be. If you pick up one of my books, I hope you can make use of the technical content and see how the photos relate to some of your own work. The most important thing, however, is to take the ideas in the book, get out there, and do some really peddle-to-the-metal creative photography. <p></p>Cameras don't take pictures; people do. This book, with Harold Davis's exquisite photos on nearly every page, teaches you professional composition tips and techniques that advance your skills to a new level. <p>Learn how to pre-visualize photos and compose images in your imagination. See in advance where your choices of lenses, lighting, focal length, and exposure will take you. Take advantage of RAW format. Master depth of field. Discover how to work with shapes, lines, and patterns, and so much more.</p> <p>Each breathtaking image in this book illustrates a compositional point. Davis explains what he had in mind and how he composed the photo to achieve his objective. The technical details are there, too: lens used, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, lighting conditions, and other relevant data.</p> <p><b>Read. Look. Indulge. And learn.</b></p> <ul> <li> Unleash the power of your imagination </li> <li> Learn to pre-visualize photos </li> <li> Find what's important about your subject </li> <li> Frame photos for impact </li> <li> Recognize powerful compositions </li> <li> Find magic in everyday objects </li> </ul></p><h2>Christmas Silhouettes: 9 Intermediate to Late Intermediate Carol Arrangements for the Piano</h2><p>The lush sounds of the season, familiar to many in Dennis Alexander&#39;s popular Magic of Christmas duet books, are infused in eight beautiful arrangements of favorite carols.

Highlighting important research findings associated with each stage of invasion, <i>Invasion Ecology</i> provides an overview of the invasion process from transportation patterns and causes of establishment success to ecological impacts, invader management, and post-invasion evolution.<br> <p>Increasing awareness of the problems associated with invasion has led to a rapid growth in research into the dynamics of non-native species and their adverse effects on native biota and human economies. This book provides a synthesis of this fast growing field of research, and is an essential text for undergraduate and graduate students in ecology and conservation management.</p></p><p>Biological invaders represent a principle threat to the maintenance of global biodiversity, human health, and the success of human economic enterprises. The continuing globalization of society ensures that the need to understand the process of biological invasion is becoming increasingly important. This is evident in the growth in grants being given for work on biological invasions (UC Davis has just received a massive grant to put together an interdisciplinary group to work on invasion biology) and the increasing number of courses being developed and taught. Recently there has been an exponential growth of published articles on the topic within top biological journals such as ecology, the american naturalist, nature, and science, as well as the rise of, biological invasions, a journal dedicated to the subject.Despite this, there are currently no textbooks on the subject. There is a proliferation of higher level monographs and research books which often focus on one person&#39;s research and on a particular species but these are of little value to teaching and most courses rely on primary literature and readings.The book will focus on ecological patterns and mechanisms of invasion biology and will target upper-division undergraduates and beginning graduate students. While covering many basic ecological theories, the textbook purposefully discusses these within the unique context of the multi-stage invasion process, starting with the transport and release of non-native organisms and moving through the establishment, spread, and impacts of invasive species.The text will have a decidedly applied tone, and will emphasize ways of testing the utility of ecological theories within an applied context using a variety of investigative techniques (e.g., observation, modeling, and experimentation). It will be comprehensive, but will rely on detailed case studies to convey many ecological themes. This approach narrows the focus of the text, and thus avoids common textbook pitfalls such as over-generalization and factual overload.It is clear from the reviews that the management of biological invaders is an important aspect of the subject that is not covered particularly well in the proposal. The authors felt that this may be the case and were happy to jig the contents list around a little to include this if the reviewers felt it important.This book provides a comprehensive introduction to all aspects of biological invasion by non-native species from transportation patterns and causes of establishment success to ecological impacts, invader management, and post-invasion evolution. <br> <ul> <li><br> </li> <li>Provides a synthesis of recent developments in the dynamics of non-native species and their adverse effects on native biota and human economies.<br> </li> <li>Is an essential text for undergraduate and graduate students in ecology and conservation management.<br> </li> <li>Artwork from the book is available to instructors online at www.blackwellpublishing.com/lockwood.</li> </ul></p><h2>Resource Management for Individuals and Families</h2><p>For courses in Family Resource Management.

These temporary labor recruitment systems represented a state-brokered compromise between employers who wanted foreign workers and those who feared rising numbers of immigrants. Unlike immigrants, guestworkers couldn't settle, bring their families, or become citizens, and they had few rights. Indeed, instead of creating a manageable form of migration, guestworker programs created an especially vulnerable class of labor.</p><p>Based on a vast array of sources from U.S., Jamaican, and English archives, as well as interviews, <i>No Man's Land</i> tells the history of the American "H2" program, the world's second oldest guestworker program. Since World War II, the H2 program has brought hundreds of thousands of mostly Jamaican men to the United States to do some of the nation's dirtiest and most dangerous farmwork for some of its biggest and most powerful agricultural corporations, companies that had the power to import and deport workers from abroad. Jamaican guestworkers occupied a no man's land between nations, protected neither by their home government nor by the United States. The workers complained, went on strike, and sued their employers in class action lawsuits, but their protests had little impact because they could be repatriated and replaced in a matter of hours.</p><p><i>No Man's Land</i> puts Jamaican guestworkers' experiences in the context of the global history of this fast-growing and perilous form of labor migration.</p></p><p><p>"<i>No Man's Land i</i>s a valuable contribution to our understanding of the factors influencing the demand for and supply of temporary foreign workers. It is thoroughly researched, well written, and a must-read for those interested in this increasingly important subject."<b>--Ray Marshall, Rapoport Centennial Chair in Economics and Public Affairs, University of Texas, Austin and former U.S. Secretary of Labor</b></p><p>"<i>In No Man's Land</i>, Cindy Hahamovitch brilliantly explores the world of guest workers and the complex history of America's relationship with them. In the confused and confusing debate over jobs, immigration, and the economy, this book is a must-read.

Crisp, authoritative, and sympathetic without being sentimental, this sophisticated narrative situates the history of guestworker programs in the postwar United States in a global-historical framework and in relation to the story's direct tie to Jamaica."<b>--Mae Ngai, author of <i>The Lucky Ones: One Family and the Extraordinary Invention of Chinese America</i></b></p><p>"<i>No Man's Land</i> is not only full of surprises but also a pleasure to read.

Relying on a broad range of sources--from police reports, films and personal interviews to sex manuals unearthed from library basements and secondhand bookstores--the book analyzes a remarkable mass mobilization during the turbulent and innovative Weimar years of doctors and laypeople for women's right to abortion and public access to birth control and sex education.<br></p><p>In Reforming Sex: The German Movement for Birth Control and Abortion Reform, 1920 to 1950, Atina Grossmann reconstructs the complicated history of a movement that has been romanticized as the harbinger of 1960s sexual radicalism and demonized as a precursor to Nazi racial policy, but mostly buried and obscured by Nazi bookburnings and repression. Relying on a broad range of sources - from police reports, films and personal interviews to sex manuals unearthed from library basements and secondhand bookstores - the book analyzes a remarkable mass mobilization during the turbulent and innovative Weimar years of doctors and laypeople for women&#39;s rights to abortion and public access to birth control and sex education. Reforming Sex takes on questions of international context and comparison as well as continuity and discontinuity in twentieth century German history in a manner that other studies have not. The book follows Weimar sex reformers into the Third Reich, to exile around the world, and into both the Eastern and Western zones of postwar Germany. It demonstrates how deeply rooted eugenics ideology and American and Bolshevik models of modernity were in the Weimar movement. It also examines the drastic rupture between sex reform notions of social health and National Socialist population policy. The story of German sex reform provides a new perspective on post-World War II family planning programs; it sheds light on the long and lively background to current controversies about abortion, the role of doctors and the state in determining women&#39;s right to control their own bodies, and the possibilities for reforming and transforming sexual relations between men and women.Atina Grossmann is at Columbia University.</p><h2>Walden: Or, Life in the Woods (Dover Large Print Classics)</h2><p>One of the great books of American letters and a masterpiece of reflective philosophizing.

This lyrical yet practical-minded book is at once a record of the 26 months Thoreau spent in withdrawal from society -- an account of the daily minutiae of building, planting, hunting, cooking, and, always, observing nature -- and a declaration of independence from the oppressive mores of the world he left behind.

This example of the potential power of genetics captured widespread media attention in 1979 and inspired the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart. This landmark investigation into the nature-nurture debate shook the scientific community by demonstrating, across a number of traits, that twins reared separately are as alike as those raised together. </p><p>As a postdoctoral fellow and then as assistant director of the Minnesota Study, Nancy L. Segal provides an eagerly anticipated overview of its scientific contributions and their effect on public consciousness. The study&#x2019;s evidence of genetic influence on individual differences in traits such as personality (50%) and intelligence (70%) overturned conventional ideas about parenting and teaching. Treating children differently and nurturing their inherent talents suddenly seemed to be a fairer approach than treating them all the same. Findings of genetic influence on physiological characteristics such as cardiac and immunologic function have led to more targeted approaches to disease prevention and treatment.

In this ample selection of largely unknown and formerly inaccessible interviews and essays, Hitchcock provides an enlivening commentary on a career that spanned decades and transformed the history of the cinema. Bringing the same exuberance and originality to his writing as he did to his films, he ranges from accounts of his own life and experiences to techniques of filmmaking and ideas about cinema in general. Wry, thoughtful, witty, and humorous&#x2014;as well as brilliantly informative&#x2014;this selection reveals another side of the most renowned filmmaker of our time.<br><br>Sidney Gottlieb not only presents some of Hitchcock's most important pieces, but also places them in their historical context and in the context of Hitchcock's development as a director. He reflects on Hitchcock's complicated, often troubled, and continually evolving relationship toward women, both on and off the set. Some of the topics Hitchcock touches upon are the differences between English and American attitudes toward murder, the importance of comedy in film, and the uses and techniques of lighting. There are also many anecdotes of life among the stars, reminiscences from the sets of some of the most successful and innovative films of this century, and incisive insights into working method, film history, and the role of film in society.<br><br>Unlike some of the complex critical commentary that has emerged on his life and work, the director's own writing style is refreshingly straightforward and accessible. Throughout the collection, Hitchcock reveals a delight and curiosity about his medium that bring all his subjects to life.</p><p>No one knew more about manipulating a movie audience than Alfred Hitchcock, the legendary master of suspense. But while many film directors have written books about their ideas and techniques, Hitchcock discussed his personal theories almost exclusively in the short articles he wrote throughout his long life. Here, for the first time, most of these hard-to-find pieces have been collected. Sidney Gottlieb&#39;s well-edited volume features Hitchcock&#39;s thoughts on actors (&#34;they should be treated like cattle&#34;), effective film editing, the power of the thriller, proper uses of a director&#39;s talents, and the keys to any good suspense film: sex and murder.

Bringing to life the striking personalities and vibrant milieu that fueled this era, Nan Alamilla Boyd examines the culture that developed around the bar scene and homophile activism. She argues that the communities forged inside bars and taverns functioned politically and, ultimately, offered practical and ideological responses to the policing of San Francisco's queer and transgender communities. Using police and court records, oral histories, tourist literature, and manuscript collections from local and state archives, Nan Alamilla Boyd explains the phenomenal growth of San Francisco as a "wide-open town"&#x2015;a town where anything goes. She also relates the early history of the gay and lesbian civil rights movement that took place in San Francisco prior to 1965. <br><br><i>Wide-Open Town </i>argues that police persecution forged debates about rights and justice that transformed San Francisco's queer communities into the identity-based groups we see today. In its vivid re-creation of bar and drag life, its absorbing portrait of central figures in the communities, and its provocative chronicling of this period in the country's most transgressive city, <i>Wide-Open Town </i>offers a fascinating and lively new chapter of American queer history.</p><p>"A smart, insightful, readable book. Boyd expertly outlines the political, economic, and legal contours of San Francisco's queer history. With a rich array of sources, she reconstructs the nightclubs and bars where customers, workers, and owners fought for the right to public assembly and helped inaugurate a movement for gay and lesbian civil rights."&#x2015;Joanne Meyerowitz, author of <i>How Sex Changed: A History of Transsexuality in the United States</i><br><br>"An outstanding book, a major contribution to U.S. gay, lesbian, and queer history. Nan Boyd has produced a fascinating account that helps us to understand why and how San Francisco has come to occupy such pride of place in the queer imagination. Traversing the complicated geography, the multiple gender and sexual cultures, and the multi-layered politics of a great metropolis, Wide-Open Town is a must-read for historians, students and scholars of sex, gender, and sexuality, and all those who have ever left their hearts in San Francisco."&#x2015;Marc Stein, author of <i>City of Sisterly and Brotherly Loves: Lesbian and Gay Philadelphia, 1945-1972</i><br><br>"Boyd spins out a fascinating story of a unique community and in the process informs our understanding of the development of gay/lesbian communities and activism in places beyond San Francisco. She does this by showing the links between and relationship of cultural resistance and various forms of political organizing, and by rethinking the ways that major events in U.S. history, such as Prohibition and the Second World War, have shaped gay/lesbian history."&#x2015;Leila J. Rupp, author of <i>A Desired Past</i><br><br>"Nan Boyd has excavated a queer pre-history of gay liberation movements in San Francisco. By highlighting sex and race tourism as well as the centrality of gender transgression to the creation of gay communities, she sheds new light on the formation of sexual identities in the twentieth century. Both insightful and highly readable, <i>Wide Open Town</i> takes lesbian and gay history a step further by locating its roots in gender subversion and through the compelling stories of individual sexual pioneers who frame her analyses."&#x2015;Estelle B.

For the first time, Professor Jan Harold Brunvand, "who has achieved almost legendary status" (<em>Choice</em>), has collected the creepiest, most terrifying urban legends, many that have spooked you since your childhood and others that you believe really did occur&#x2015;even if it was one town over to some poor hapless coed who left a party early only to be followed by a man who just got loose from a mental hospital. From the classic hook-man story told around many a campfire to "Saved by a Cell Phone," these spine-tingling urban legends will give you goose bumps, even when you know they can't be true. Still, you'll continue to check the backseat of your car at gas stations and look under your bed at night before praying for sleep.</p><p>Jan Harold Brunvand lives in Salt Lake City, where he is professor emeritus at the University of Utah. He is the author of numerous books, including The Vanishing Hitchhiker; The Choking Doberman; The Baby Train; Too Good to Be True; and Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid.Rum flavored by a dead man in the cask; black widow spiders nesting in beehive hairdos; women&#x2019;s intestines broiled by tanning booths; teenage couples menaced by men with hooks for hands: if these are the sorts of tales that thrill and chill you, this an anthology worth picking up. Folklorist Brunvand (The Vanishing Hitchhiker) assembles a creepy cornucopia of urban legends, organizing them by theme ("Chills Up Your Spine," "Accidents") and considering them in a surprisingly sedate manner. The result is a blend of "primary text" urban legends (transcribed from field interviews, collected from e-mails or reprinted from local newspapers) and more reflective introductions that consider the motifs and variations of each urban legend. Some tales are old chestnuts, familiar to anyone who&#x2019;s been to a camp or a slumber party in the past 50 years, but others indicate more contemporary fears: stories of vacationers waking in unfamiliar hotel rooms, groggy and minus a kidney, or rumors of sexual predators who purposefully spread HIV to their unsuspecting partners. Brunvand traces most of these legends to their roots and debunks some of the more widespread ones, but he never lets his skepticism dampen his enthusiasm for the stories themselves. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Since the facts don't do that too often, I decided to make it up. . . . That is the real power and joy of being an artist. We can make it come true. Or look true."&#x2014;Faith Ringgold, in a 1992 interview<br><br>This catalog is the first book-length publication devoted to the exquisite story quilts of contemporary artist Faith Ringgold. Combining painted images, handwritten texts, and quilting techniques, Ringgold weaves together modernist painting; feminist critique; postmodernist strategies of appropriation, parody, and montage; and personal memoir in a remarkable synthesis that takes on European modernism, African American folk art, and the "black aesthetic" of the 1960s and 1970s. The catalog accompanies an exhibition of <i>The French Collection</i> and <i>The American Collection</i>, a series of story quilts Ringgold has produced since 1990. Catalog essays include an examination of Ringgold's stylistic development through the 1960s and 1970s, an exploration of the social and political aspects of the story quilts, and a recollection by the artist's daughter, writer Michele Wallace.<br><br>Ringgold has adapted the tradition of the American slave quilt to create a world in which African Americans and women dominate, where history is not only questioned but also reinvented. The titles of the quilts in Ringgold's <i>French Collection</i> and <i>American Collection</i> suggest her subject range and daring: <i>Jo Baker's Birthday Party</i>; <i>Dinner at Gertrude Stein's</i>; <i>A Portrait of Aunt Jemima</i>; <i>Tubman, Douglass, and Truth: Wanted Dead or Alive</i> are examples. Faith Ringgold's broad audience of admirers (her books for children have won Caldecott and <i>New York Times</i> book illustration honors) will welcome <i>Dancing at the Louvre</i>. Finally there is a book that displays her artistic achievements and provides a full discussion of her importance within contemporary art.</p><p>No matter how society conspires to usher certain groups toward its dimly lit margins, some folks always work their way back to the center waving and shouting. Faith Ringgold redefines the solemn artistic canon represented by Van Gogh, Matisse, and Monet with her intricate, glorious story quilts. Their fabric and paint layers combine magical realism with politics, feminism, satire, memoir and the weight of African American history. <i>Dancing at the Louvre</i> was designed to accompany a traveling show of Ringgold's work. It pairs gorgeously rendered color plates with pithy text on her art, life, and politics. Her "French Collection" quilts feature protagonist Willia X enlivening--no, reviving--classical European art and tableaus. In "The Sunflower Quilting Bee at Arles," Van Gogh carries his awkward, brilliant sunflowers to a table where Willia X mingles with the likes of Rosa Parks, Fannie Lou Hamer, and Sojourner Truth, "a fortress of African American women's courage, with enough energy to transform a nation piece by piece," writes Ringgold along the quilt border. Other pieces, such as the folk art "Who's Afraid of Aunt Jemima" and the unalloyed anger of "The Flag is Bleeding" conjure the pain of racism. <i>--Francesca Coltrera</i>"This multivocal medley of texts provides a long overdue discussion in depth of Faith Ringgold's work.

Fitzgerald grew up writing--her father, E. V. Knox, was editor of <i>Punch</i> from 1932 to 1949--and is renowned for her understated style, a habit of restraint that makes for agile and piquant criticism. An extraordinarily discerning reader, Fitzgerald offers strong opinions on the art of biography; expert assessments of visual art, including illustration and cartoons; a keen sense of place; and avid interest in both lesser-known writers such as Charlotte Mew and such giants as William Blake and George Eliot.

By linking theory to 21st century culture, this book resonates with students in a way that few other books do, opening their eyes to many current issues, especially in consumption and globalization. As in previous editions, the book has been updated and it offers new discussions of, among others, In-N-Out- Burger and Pret A Manger as possible antitheses of McDonaldization. The biggest change, however, is that the book has been radically streamlined to offer an even clearer articulation of the now-famous McDonaldization thesis.</p><p><p><strong>George Ritzer</strong> is Distinguished University Professor at the University of Maryland, where he has also been a Distinguished Scholar-Teacher and won a Teaching Excellence Award.

The particular objective is to situate four gang members as literate, caring students from loving families whose identities and literacy keep them on the margins of school. The research described in this book suggests that advocacy is a particularly effective form of critical ethnography. Smith and Whitmore argue that until schools, as communities of practice, enable children and adolescents to retain identities from the communities in which they are full community members, frightening numbers of students are destined to fail.<br><br>The stories of four Mexican American male adolescents, who were active members of a gang and Smith's students in an alternative high school program, portray the complicated, multiple worlds in which these boys live. As sons and teenage parents they live in a family community; as CRIP members they live in a gang community; as "at risk" students, drop-outs, and graduates they live in a school community, and as a result of their illegal activities they live in the juvenile court community. The authors theorize about the boys' literacy in each of their communities. Literacy is viewed as ideological, related to power, and embedded in a sociocultural context. Vivid examples of conversation, art, tagging, rap, poetry, and other language and literacy events bring the narratives to life in figures and photographs in all the chapters. Readers will find this book engaging and readable, yet thought provoking and challenging.<br><br>Audiences for <i>Literacy and Advocacy in Adolescent Family, Gang, School, and Juvenile Court Communities</i> include education researchers, professionals, and students in the areas of middle/high school education, at-risk adolescent psychology, and alternative community programs--specifically those interested in literacy education, sociocultural theory, and popular culture.<br></p><p><p><i>This volume is an ethnographic study of four Mexican American male adolescents and their involvement in gangs and school.

From the prop-driven armada of World War II to the most advanced Stealth weaponry, from pioneers like General Henry "Hap" Arnold to glorious conquests in the Gulf War, B<i>eyond the Wild Blue</i> is a high-flying study of the triumphs (and failures) of leadership and technology.In three new chapters, Walter Boyne&nbsp;covers an eventful ten years, including 9/11, the invasion of Afghanistan,&nbsp;and the second Gulf War, describing in detail the&nbsp;technological advancements that led to highly efficient airstrikes in&nbsp;Iraq.&nbsp; He also takes stock of the Air Force's&nbsp;doctrine and mission statements&nbsp;as this unique sector of the military grapples with an ever-changing world.</p><p>WALTER&nbsp;J. BOYNE is a retired colonel of the United States Air Force, and the former Director of the National Air and Space Museum.&nbsp; He has written&nbsp;forty books of fiction and nonfiction, including the bestselling <i>Weapons of the Gulf War</i> and <i>The Wild Blue</i> (written with Steven L. Thomson).&nbsp; He makes his home in Ashburn, Virginia.1&nbsp;The Man of Influence&nbsp;In just sixty years the United States Air Force has grown from a disorganized giant, mired in the jumble of too rapid demobilization after World War II, to the most influential military service in the world today. In the process it has achieved triumphant successes that exceeded even the promise of its evocative song "The Wild Blue Yonder" while overcoming haunting failures of concept, equipment, and personnel.&nbsp;Fortunately for the United States and the world, the successes have vastly outnumbered the failures in both number and degree. Until September 11, 2001, the Air Force has been a significant, if not the principal, factor in the remarkable victories of both the Gulf War and the Cold War. Every leader of the United States Air Force, from Secretary to Chief of Staff to squadron commander, would be quick to note that these triumphs were won in concert with the Army and the Navy. No matter how hotly the three services contend for roles and missions, appropriations, media attention, and public support, the serious bickering stops when it comes to battle. The concept of joint operations, so successful in World War II, was not always observed in the intervening years, but was demonstrated admirably in the Gulf War, operations in the Balkins, in Afghanistan, and in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Nonetheless, while much of what will be said applies equally to its sister services, this book will focus on the United States Air Force.&nbsp;The Air Force achieved its great successes despite a number of formidable obstacles, foreign and domestic. The first and most immediate of these was the talented, focused, and effective air forces of the Soviet Union, which developed excellent equipment in massive numbers along with the strategy and tactics to use it. The USSR shared its capabilities bountifully with its satellite states, some of which were destined to become fierce opponents of the United States. The threat of the Soviet Union was real, massive, and seemingly never-ending. Soviet nuclear missile capability, exaggerated at first, soon grew to immense proportions. And while the Soviet Union is no more, its missile force, now divided among three of the survivor states, Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, not only remains but is perhaps more threatening because its control is far less certain.&nbsp;There were less obvious but equally important hazards at home. The first of these was the continual requirement to cope not only with the vagaries of the Congressional budgeting process but also with the growing restrictions inherent in oversight--a kindly term for micromanagement by both Congress and the Executive Branch. The second was the telling loss of public support, almost two decades in duration, resulting from distaste for the war in Vietnam. For the first time in its history, members of the United States Air Force found themselves publicly vilified for doing what they had been ordered to do. And while the prestige of the USAF has been largely restored today, there lurks a reservoir of antimilitary sentiment still to be found in the media, in academia, and, surprisingly, in the government.&nbsp;Most remarkably, even while the Air Force struggled to overcome these varied challenges, it created and maintained a unique ability to plan far into the future. The Air Force's reliance on technology was perhaps inherent in the very science of flight itself. More than the Army or the Navy, and more than the services of other nations, including the Soviet Union, the Air Force put its faith in advanced technologies. Fostered from the very start by General of the Air Force Henry H. "Hap" Arnold, and encouraged by succeeding Chiefs of Staff, the Air Force not only made the funds available for research, it granted credibility and opportunity to the military and civilian personnel who pursued technology as a career. The funding was not always constant, for wartime operational considerations invariably drained funds away from research, but the basic idea that research and development was the essential element for the continued success of the Air Force always remained.&nbsp;Despite every effort to avoid the characteristics and the operating methods of a giant bureaucracy, the very size and age of the Air Force has made it one. Prescience is not normally associated with a huge organization, yet the Air Force has over the years managed to endow its leadership and its operating forces with the ability to anticipate future requirements for equipment and training. The phenomenal result has been that the Air Force, operating under the budget constraints imposed upon all the services, has managed all current crises while doing the necessary research and development to accelerate the technologies necessary for future conflicts.&nbsp;For forty years the principal task of the United States Air Force was to deter offensive action by the Soviet Union. The USAF accomplished this in part by combining the experience and techniques gained in the employment of air power in World War II with an ever increasing arsenal of atomic weapons, including the intercontinental ballistic missile. The rest of the task was achieved when the Air Force, drawn reluctantly and against its instincts into the space age, responded by capitalizing on the opportunity to create an amazing array of new technologies.&nbsp;At the same time, the USAF had to respond to other challenges. Some of these were of the monumental size and scope of the Korean and Vietnamese wars, while some were less threatening, like the invasions of Grenada and Panama. In addition, the USAF had to undertake disaster relief at home and abroad, as well as show the flag and project power. And all the while, it had to deal with major social issues ranging from the integration of black personnel into the service, to overcoming civilian distaste for the military during and after the Vietnam War period, to providing equal opportunity for women and minorities.&nbsp;Despite the multifaceted nature of the Air Force's tasks, it was successful in almost all of them, all the while containing the Soviet Union and making the most vital contributions to winning the Cold War. It was next thrust into a peacekeeping role in the Balkans. Then, as the global war on terror became manifest, it became actively engaged in new operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.&nbsp;In retrospect, the years of the Cold War have a monolithic quality, as if there had been an unchanging confrontation with the Soviet Union which the Air Force steadfastly met with unchanging means. Yet it was not so, for the nature of the threat changed almost annually, forcing a corresponding change in the Air Force's response. In the very early years, at the time of the Berlin Blockade, the Air Force's response was a hollow one, brandishing a nearly empty nuclear arsenal at a gigantic array of Soviet forces. As the years passed, the Soviet Union, through its surrogates, challenged the United States all around the world, in each instance with a minimal involvement of its own troops. Thus it fought the Korean War with North Korean and Chinese forces, supplemented by Soviet equipment, training, and limited personnel. It supported the North Vietnamese in a similar economic manner, letting another country bleed for its own purposes. The same pattern prevailed in the Middle East, in Africa, and ultimately as close as Cuba. With the Soviet Union tugging at the seams of countries all around the world, the U.S. policy of containment, begun by President Truman, was an expensive one.&nbsp;Yet it was ultimately successful, despite the lack of a decision in Korea and the loss of the war in Vietnam. Over the years, the United States Air Force, both the benefactor and the beneficiary of the American system of free enterprise, was able to build air and missile forces that kept the Soviet Union within the general sphere of influence allotted to it at Yalta.&nbsp;The Soviet Union was not only contained, it was strained, its military budget consuming it economically and technically. The Soviet advances in military equipment and in space exploration were obtained by investments that matched and often exceeded those of the United States, particularly as a percentage of gross national product. The tremendous expenditures were at the expense of a rational expansion of the USSR's civilian economy. The productive capacity of the Soviet Union, channeled so single-mindedly into its military efforts (for its space program was primarily for military purposes), was unable to develop an industrial base with a technology and a market structure comparable to those of its old Western enemies or of the emerging nations of Asia. The USSR's atrophied civilian industrial base made its military burden increasingly difficult to bear by 1980, and impossible to bear a decade later.&nbsp;In that critical ten-year period, three separate undertakings by the United States spelled the downfall of the Soviet Union. The first was the buildup of American arms that began in 1980 and reversed the decline in strength that had occurred under the Carter administration. The Soviet economy, already almost exhausted, was strained beyond endurance by the requirement to match the American buildup.&nbsp;The second undertaking was the dazzling if ultimately unfulfilled prospects of President Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" program. The grandiose project was obviously beyond the capacity of the Soviet Union to match; the risk that the United States might succeed was too much for Soviet leaders to contemplate.&nbsp;The third, and conclusive, element was the overwhelming success of our weapons in the Persian Gulf War. The invulnerability of the stealth fighter and the incredible military--and public relations--effect of precision-guided munitions completely disheartened the political and military leaders of the Soviet Union. With their economy imploding under the strain of seventy-four years of corruption and inefficiency, the Soviet leaders were finally compelled to admit that their system had failed, and to abandon--at least temporarily--their historic quest for world domination. Just as Mussolini's corrupt Fascism withered and died almost overnight, so did the Soviet Union and its single political component, the Communist Party, swiftly dissolve into a nightmare of confusion and recrimination.&nbsp;The Soviet Union, suddenly exposed as a gigantic empty rust belt of industrial and political folly, simply shut down, leaving its people to its own devices, for better or for worse. Its huge military forces, overwhelming in both their conventional and nuclear might, almost instantaneously went from being a threat to the very existence of the world to embarrassing centers of poverty, unable to feed, equip, or clothe their recruits, sometimes unable even to pay their electric bills.&nbsp;Yet winning the Cold War was only part of the United States Air Force's task during the first fifty years of its existence. Each decade presented a new challenge that it had to handle as a "part-time" job, subsidiary to the principal task of nuclear deterrence. Some of the challenges were internal: adapting to social change, meeting equipment deficiencies, trying each year to do more with less. Other challenges were external, from the sobering experience in Korea through the demoralizing agony of Vietnam to the exhilaration of winning the Persian Gulf War. The exertions of the global war on terror after 9/11 were compounded by additional requirements for compassionate relief efforts and the increasing interest in securing our borders from illegal immigration.&nbsp;Each challenge was overcome by the men and women of the Air Force, who were simultaneously accomplishing another remarkable feat. Even as they endured the rigors and uncertainties of service life, with its frequent moves, relatively low pay, and often disagreeable jobs, the men and women of the Air Force moved into the mainstream of the American community, and indeed became the United States in microcosm. The old concept of a military base being apart from the community, a self-sufficient entity with its own standards and mores, faded away. USAF personnel increasingly broke away from the frontier outpost outlook that had characterized the military for so many years and instead became active members of their communities, owning homes, working second jobs, sending their children to school, paying taxes, and generally becoming indistinguishable from their civilian neighbors.&nbsp;One of the most remarkable aspects of this transformation from a parochial group with an essentially garrison mentality into a fundamental part of American society is that it has been rarely perceived and little remarked upon, even by members of the Air Force. People both within and without the Air Force still tend to think of it as a separate social entity, as distinct from being a separate business entity. The fact is that the composition of the Air Force population is essentially identical to the composition of the American populace as a whole, and as such reflects the trends, the biases, the problems, and the potential of that populace.&nbsp;One of the most interesting questions about the Air Force is how it managed to foresee its equipment and weapons needs as much one or two decades in advance. The successes obtained in World War II might be attributed to a specialized leadership, trained for twenty years with but a single goal, that of establishing air superiority with conventional weapons of the times. The postwar successes, each one perhaps as important as success in battle had been in World War II, resulted from the quick and precise execution of plans that would have been deemed grandiose if they had not succeeded. Among the most remarkable of these for the grandeur of their conception, planning, and execution are the deployment of not one but four intercontinental ballistic missile systems, the establishment of a comprehensive continental radar defense, and the systematic exploitation of the possibilities of space for war and other military purposes.&nbsp;In the meantime, besides leading the way to victory in the Cold War, the Air Force has, almost off the back of its hand, fought four major and three minor wars, while leading the nation in the process of integrating minorities and women into the service. During the same interval, it has transitioned from a primarily nuclear strike force pitted against a superpower into one capable of responding to regional conflicts with conventional arms, while still maintaining a decisive nuclear capacity.&nbsp;The answers to the question of the source of the Air Force's general success in operation and in anticipation will be revealed in the following chapters. In essence, the Air Force's success derived from having the right leaders at the right time at the officer level and, perhaps surprisingly but even more importantly, at the noncommissioned officer level. Obtaining those leaders derived from the Air Force's intrinsic ability to attract high-caliber personalities to serve, and from a carefully cultivated culture that allows persons of talent to reach the top. The relationship between officers, noncommissioned officers, and enlisted personnel in the USAF is unique, and stems from a tradition created in the old days when commissioned pilots realized that their lives depended upon noncommissioned crew chiefs--and treated them accordingly. The sense of mutual respect and mutual importance is pervasive in the Air Force today,...</p><h2>Jewish Spiritual Guidance: Finding Our Way to God (The Jossey-Bass Religion-In-Practice Series)</h2><p><b>A Map for the Inner Journey, for Seekers and Guides Alike</b> <p>Written with warmth, compassion, and deep understanding, this book offers a map of the inner journey for exploring the time-honored practice of spiritual guidance.

For example, when we say that in toss� ing a coin, the probability of its coming up "heads" is 1/2, we usually mean that in a large number of tosses, about 1/2 of the tosses will come up heads. Unfortunately, relative frequency of occurrence has proved to be an unsatis� factory starting point in defining probability. Although there have been attempts to make frequency of occurrence part of the axiomatic structure of probability theory, the currently accepted formu1ation is one based on measure theory due to Ko1mogorov. In this formulation frequency of occurrence is an interpretation for probability rather than adefinition. This inter� pretation is justified under suitab1e conditions by the 1aw of 1arge numbers. The starting point of probability theory is usua11y taken to be an experi� ment the outcome of which is not fixed apriori. Some fami1iar examples inc1ude tossing a die, observation of a noise vo1tage at a fixed time, the error in measuring a physica1 parameter, and the exact touchdown time of an aircraft. Let ~ denote the set of all possib1e outcomes of an experiment. For examp1e, for the experiment of tossing one die, ~ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, whi1e for the touchdown time of an aircraft, ~ might be chosen to be 0 ~ t &lt; 00. We note that for a given experiment on1y one outcome is ever observed.</p><p></p><h2>Fourier Analysis of Time Series: An Introduction (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics - Applied Probability and Statistics Section)</h2><p><b>A new, revised edition of a yet unrivaled work on frequency domain analysis</b><p>Long recognized for his unique focus on frequency domain methods for the analysis of time series data as well as for his applied, easy-to-understand approach, Peter Bloomfield brings his well-known 1976 work thoroughly up to date.

Though originally published separately, these prose poems have always been intended as a loose trilogy of thought and feelingor of thought manifested as feeling. The author comments: "Just as the title <em>Curves to the Apple</em> combines the organic and geometry (not to mention myth and history of science) the poems navigate the conflicting, but inextricable claims of body and mind, especially the female body and feelings in a space of logic and physics. The poems could all be called dialogic, reaching out across a synaptic (sometimes humorous) gap to a possible 'you' (though it may be rhetorical, another point of view in the same mind). But while the 'I' dominates the first two volumes, the third gives both voices equal space and chance."</p><p><strong>Rosmarie Waldrop</strong> was born in Germany and has lived in the United States since 1958.

These strategies are research based and classroom tested, and can be used in literature focus units, reading and writing workshop, or thematic units. Many new instructional strategies, such as interactive writing, story retelling, and word sorts, have been recommended for classroom use, but locating information about how to implement these strategies can be difficult and time consuming. Each strategy begins with a grid that recommends the most appropriate usage and answers the following questions at a glance: </p> <ol> <li>Does the strategy fit best as part of a literature focus unit, for reading and writing workshop, for literature circles, or for reading and writing during the thematic unit?</li> <li>For what grade level does the strategy work best?</li> <li>Does the strategy work best for individuals, pairs, small groups, or the entire class?</li> </ol> <p> Of course, these are only recommendations. Once you become comfortable with the basic steps, you may want to experiment and augment these ideas with your own. </p> <p> After the grid, the instructional strategy is described briefly and the benefits of using the strategy are explained. Next, the steps in using that specific literacy strategy are listed. Best of all, applications and examples are provided that describe ways experienced teachers have used the instructional procedure. References allow you to find out more about the strategy on your own and demonstrate that the strategy has been proven successful in helping students develop into capable readers and writers. </p> <p><b>KEY FEATURES</b></p> <ul> <li>Strategies are arranged alphabetically and numbered for easy reference. Inside the cover of the book is an index that groups the strategies by concept, providing another easy guide to finding the strategy you need.</li> <li>Everything you need to know to implement the strategy effectively and quickly is included in a consistent, easy-to-understand format.</li> <li>Complete step-by-step instructions with illustrations are provided to guide you.</li> <li>Applications and examples are included to demonstrate strategies and to stimulate your own creativity.</li> <li><b>New!</b> ELL Notes point out the strategies most effective for English language learners.</li> </ul> <p><b>USING THIS BOOK</b></p> <p> <i>Fifty Literacy Strategies: Step by Step</i> can be used as a supplementary textbook in any reading, literacy, or language arts methods course. It can also be used as a core text for inservice training or staff development workshops. Gail E.

This statement is an apt motto for the lifework of Theodosius Dobzhansky, whom Stephen Jay Gould has called "the greatest evolutionary geneticist of our times." Between 1937 and 1975, the year of his death, Dobzhansky and twenty-two of his collaborators published forty-three papers in a series called "The Genetics of Natural Populations." Taken as a whole, the series is perhaps the most important single corpus in modern evolutionary genetics.<br><br><i>Dobzhansky's Genetics of Natural Populations, I-XLIII</i> reproduces these forty-three articles. Because three of the four editor's of this volume are former students and long-time collaborators of Dobzhansky, they are able to set these important papers in critical perspective. The editors briefly evaluate the totality of Dobzhansky's work and summarize the views expressed in the series&#x2015;including the historic development of Dobzhansky's ideas on genetic variation. Critical comments illuminate the relationship of the papers to each other and to Dobzhansky's other work. In addition, the editors discuss the role of Dobzhansky's interaction with Alfred Sturtevant and Sewall Wright.<br><br>In particular, the book features Dobzhansky's pioneering field studies of <i>Drosophila pseudoobscura</i>, which were critical in the formulation of some of his most important conclusions about the genetic structure of populations and, more broadly, about the way evolution works.</p><p>A reproduction of the forty-three articles that make up &#34;The Genetics of Natural Populations&#34; series, perhaps the most important single corpus in modern evolutionary genetics.R.

Both engagements bolstered national confidence and spoke to the �lan of citizen soldiers and their militia officers. The Battle of New Orleans&#x2015;perhaps because it punctuated the war, lent itself to frontier mythology, and involved the larger-than-life figure of Andrew Jackson&#x2015;became especially important in popular memory. In <i>Glorious Victory</i>, leading War of 1812 scholar Donald R. Hickey recounts the New Orleans campaign and Jackson&#x2019;s key role in the battle.</p><p>Drawing on a lifetime of research, Hickey tells the story of America&#x2019;s "forgotten conflict."

The book begins to remedy that neglect, first by celebrating the richness and ingenuity of the world of Islamic technology and then by pointing the way forward to its more detailed exploration. Lavishly illustrated, this book explores the major technological achievements of Islamic civilisations, namely the public works of civil engineering, the machines and mechanical devices which served to control water, provide power, serve as instruments or to amuse.</p><p>In this lavishly illustrated 1986 survey, two distinguished historians and engineers assess the major achievements of Islamic civilisation.

In the&nbsp;clearest possible prose it differentiates the firmly established from&nbsp;the&nbsp;speculative and examines the claims of various fields such as string theory to approach a unified theory of everything. In doing so it challenges the orthodox consensus in those branches of cosmology,&nbsp;biology, and neuroscience that have ossified into dogma.Its striking analysis reveals&nbsp;underlying patterns of cooperation, complexification, and convergence that&nbsp;lead&nbsp;to the unique emergence in humans of a self-reflective consciousness that&nbsp;enables&nbsp;us to determine our future evolution.This&nbsp;groundbreaking book is destined to become a classic of scientific thinking.(67 black and white illustrations)</p><p>John Hands has devoted more than ten years to evaluating scientific theories about human evolution from the origin of the universe.

So begins <em>Preachin' the Blues</em>, the biography of American blues signer and guitarist Eddie James "Son" House, Jr. (1902 - 1988). House pioneered an innovative style, incorporating strong repetitive rhythms with elements of southern gospel and spiritual vocals. A seminal figure in the history of the Delta blues, he was an important, direct influence on such figures as Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson.<br> The landscape of Son House's life and the vicissitudes he endured make for an absorbing narrative, threaded through with a tension between House's religious beliefs and his spells of commitment to a lifestyle that implicitly rejected it. Drinking, womanizing, and singing the blues caused this tension that is palpable in his music, and becomes explicit in one of his finest performances, "Preachin' the Blues." Large parts of House's life are obscure, not least because his own accounts of them were inconsistent. Author Daniel Beaumont offers a chronology/topography of House's youth, taking into account evidence that conflicts sharply with the well-worn fable, and he illuminates the obscurity of House's two decades in Rochester, NY between his departure from Mississippi in the 1940s and his "rediscovery" by members of the Folk Revival Movement in 1964. Beaumont gives a detailed and perceptive account of House's primary musical legacy: his recordings for Paramount in 1930 and for the Library of Congress in 1941-42. In the course of his research Beaumont has unearthed not only connections among the many scattered facts and fictions but new information about a rumoured murder in Mississippi, and a charge of manslaughter on Long Island - incidents which bring tragic light upon House's lifelong struggles and self-imposed disappearance, and give trenchant meaning to the moving music of this early blues legend.<br></p><p><br>Daniel Beaumont teaches courses on Arabic language and literature and the blues at the University of Rochester. He is the author of <em>Slave of Desire: Sex, Love and Death in The 1001 Nights</em> (Associated University Presses 2002). He produced and directed "So Much Truth" a documentary about bluesman Joe Beard. He also worked as chief observer on a rain making project in Libya and he has been on the historic "King Biscuit Time" blues radio show.<br><br>"Beaumont's work shines especially in his depiction of House's nonrecording years... the definitive portrait of this unjustly neglected lion of American Music." --<em>Library Journal </em> (starred review) <br><p></p><br>"Beaumont offers vivid portraits of the pre-WWII blues scene and the mid-1960s efforts of white ethnomusicologists to rediscover and promote blues singers." <br>--Alan Moores, <em>Booklist </em><p></p><br>"Daniel Beaumont, who teaches Arabic language and literature at the University of Rochester, has produced an eloquent study of House's life and travails." --Benjamin Ivry, <em>Star-Ledger</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Preachin' the Blues</em> achieves what any music biographer most aspires to: It makes a reader want to seek out the music it describes. And even in an iTunes age, when Son House's <em>Levee Camp Moan</em> can be found with a click instead of a drive to Rochester, it's still a journey with rich rewards." --Charles R.

It is the sort of apocalyptic vision that was widespread at the time, though Shelley&#x2019;s treatment of the theme goes beyond the conventional; it is extraordinarily interesting and deeply moving. </p> <p> If <em>The Last Man</em> is in some sense a &#x201c;conventional&#x201d; text of the period, it is also intensely personal in its origin; Shelley refers in her journal to the last man as her alter ego, &#x201c;the last relic of a beloved race, my companions extinct before me.&#x201d; The novel thus develops out of and contributes to a network of story and idea in which fantasy, allusion, convention, and autobiography are densely interwoven. </p> <p> This new version of the first edition (1826) sets out to provide not only a thoroughly annotated text, but also contextual materials to help the reader acquire knowledge of the intellectual and literary milieu out of which the novel emerged. Appendices include material on &#x201c;the last man&#x201d; as early nineteenth-century hero, texts from the debate initiated by Malthus in 1798 about the adequacy of food supply to sustain human population, various accounts of outbreaks of plague, and Shelley&#x2019;s poems representing her feelings after the death of her husband.</p>Daughter of political philosopher William Godwin and feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley edited the works of her husband, Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and is best known as the author of <i>Frankenstein</i>.</p><h2>Companion Animals: Their Biology, Care, Health, and Management (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Comprehensive and up-to-date, this book makes a useful reference devoted to companion animals.

But in <i>Constantine and the Bishops</i>, historian H. A. Drake offers a fresh and more nuanced understanding of Constantine's rule and, especially, of his relations with Christians.</p><p>Constantine, Drake suggests, was looking not only for a god in whom to believe but also a policy he could adopt. Uncovering the political motivations behind Constantine's policies, Drake shows how those policies were constructed to ensure the stability of the empire and fulfill Constantine's imperial duty in securing the favor of heaven.</p><p>Despite the emperor's conversion to Christianity, Drake concludes, Rome remained a world filled with gods and with men seeking to depose rivals from power. A book for students and scholars of ancient history and religion, <i>Constantine and the Bishops</i> shows how Christian belief motivated and gave shape to imperial rule.</p></p><p><p><b>H. A. Drake </b> is a professor of history at the University of California, Santa Barbara. </p><p>"A refreshingly original and powerfully argued re-conception of the issues and the forces at work in this period of the conversion not of Constantine, but of Christianity... With laser-keen insight, bold thinking, and also a large measure of wry humor, Drake has presented a plausible and powerful interpretation of this formative moment in Western history... A riveting story, and masterfully told. Anyone who rejoices in our Founding Fathers' constitutional conviction that church must be kept separate from state will read <i>Constantine and the Bishops</i> with deepest appreciation; and perhaps those who long for the opposite should read it, too. The lessons of late antiquity remain pertinent, alas, to the politics of religion in our own day."</p> (Paula Fredriksen <i>New Republic</i>)<br><br><p>"If you read one book on late antiquity this year, read this one. If you read one book on politics this year, read this one again... A work of visionary brilliance."</p> (<i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i>)<br><br><p>"The strength of this work is Drake's skillful use of a wide range of scholarship... This is a stimulating book, with a persuasive thesis."</p> (Nathan Howard <i>Journal of Church and State</i>)<br><br><p>"In its scholarship and size <i>Constantine and the Bishops</i> is clearly a work to benefit scholars, but the clarity of its explanations make it accessible to the enterprising undergraduate as well."</p> (Ronald J. Weber <i>History: Reviews of New Books</i>)<br><br><p>"Compelling... His overarching thesis provides a persuasive new paradigm."</p> (David Brakke <i>Journal of Religion</i>)<br><br><p>"A well organized, well documented, and well written study."</p> (Richard A. Lebrun <i>H-Catholic, H-Net Reviews</i>)<br><br><p>"This is a learned, broadly based, and carefully elaborated argument. It is also racily written, interesting, and hard to put down."</p> (Stuart G. Hall <i>Journal of Theological Studies</i>)<br><br><p>"A thoughtful and erudite book that breaks the mold... A powerful study with a strong, coherent thesis, <i>Constantine and the Bishops</i> is animated by a fresh vision of the early fourth century. It skillfully incorporates major historical themes in unexpected and rewarding ways."</p> (Richard Lim <i>Speculum</i>)</p><h2>Chemistry: An Atoms-Focused Approach</h2><p><p><strong>Not just Atoms First, Atoms Focused. An atoms first text and media program that goes beyond a reorganization of topics, emphasizes the particulate nature of matter throughout the book, art, and problems, and helps students develop their molecular visualization skills as they learn to become expert problem solvers.</strong></p> The Second Edition's new co author, Stacey Lowery Bretz, uses visualization tools&#x2015;based on Chemistry Education Research, and focused on the particulate nature of matter&#x2015;to help students self assess what they know before, during, and after each chapter. Smartwork5 allows instructors to use this pedagogy as a diagnostic, and students receive hints and answer specific feedback within the text.

Unlike traditional productivity applications, which you buy, install on your computer, and later upgrade yourself (for an additional fee), Google Docs&#x2019; applications are Web-based. That means your documents, spreadsheets, and presentations are stored on the Web, and you can access them from anywhere you have an Internet connection and a Web browser. Imagine the possibilities: No more having to remember to transfer a file from your desktop computer to your laptop before you hit the road. No more wondering whether the version you&#x2019;re working on is the current version. No more having to back up all your documents&#x2014;because Google&#x2019;s got you covered.</p> <p>And if you sometimes need to work when you&#x2019;re offline, Google&#x2019;s got you covered there, too. When you install Google Gears (Chapter 3 tells you how), you can work on your documents and view your spreadsheets even when you&#x2019;re not connected to the Internet. Using Gears to work offline is optional; you don&#x2019;t have to install it to use Google Docs.</p> <p>But one of the greatest advantages of Google Docs is the ability to share your documents with others&#x2014;and collaborate on them in real time. If you&#x2019;ve ever collaborated by emailing a flurry of files or waiting for someone else to check a document back into a central repository (so you can have your turn), you&#x2019;ll love collaborating in Google Docs. When you share a document with some collaborators, those people can sign in and work on the document whenever they want, from wherever they are. Multiple collaborators can work on a document at the same time. All edits happen to the current version of the document, so you never have to worry about working on an out-of-date file. (If someone makes edits you need to undo, you can roll back to a previous version using Google Docs&#x2019; revision history feature.)</p> <p>Best of all, Google Docs is free. Yes, you heard that right&#x2014;it won&#x2019;t cost you a penny to use. There&#x2019;s nothing to install on your computer, and Google takes care of fixing bugs and updating the applications.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s no wonder that organizations&#x2014;including GE, L&#x2019;Oreal, the District of Columbia, and Google itself&#x2014;are evaluating or switching to Google for their productivity tools. And it&#x2019;s no wonder that millions of individuals are choosing Google Docs to create, edit, and store their documents. Given that you are reading this introduction, you&#x2019;ve probably done the same (or are thinking about it). Whether for business or personal use, this book will help you get the most out of Google Docs.</p> <p><b>A Quick Overview of This Book</b></p> <p>Google Docs lets you create and work with three kinds of documents:</p> <ul> <li>Word-processing documents&#x2014;From letters, memos, or reports to the Great American Novel, documents are anything that you might create with a word processor such as Microsoft Word, OpenOffice.org Writer, WordPerfect, and so on.</li> <li>Spreadsheets&#x2014;Whether you&#x2019;re creating a schedule, tracking your stock portfolio, figuring out your household budget, cataloging your wine collection, or something else, you can use a Google Docs spreadsheet. A spreadsheet is a grid of columns and rows you can use to organize information and perform calculations on that information.</li> <li>Presentations&#x2014;A presentation is a series of slides that you show in sequence. Traditionally, Microsoft PowerPoint has been the most popular presentation program.</li> </ul> <p>After an introductory chapter to get you started with Google Docs, this book is organized by the different kinds of documents and what you can do with them:</p> <ul> <li>Chapter 1, &#x201c;Getting Started with Google Docs,&#x201d; tells you how to create a Google account (a must for using Docs), how to use the Google Docs home page to organize and search your documents, and how to maximize your efficiency to make Google Docs work with iGoogle, Google&#x2019;s personal and highly customizable start page.</li> <li>Chapter 2, &#x201c;Starting Word Processing,&#x201d; takes you through the steps of creating and saving your first document in Google Docs. The chapter also covers the basics of formatting text and shows you how to use helpful keyboard shortcuts and print a document.</li> <li>Chapter 3, &#x201c;Formatting Documents,&#x201d; goes beyond the basics. Topics in this chapter include formatting documents, using templates to create preformatted documents, importing existing documents into Google Docs (and exporting your Docs documents to another program, such as Word), using Google&#x2019;s research tools, and editing documents when you&#x2019;re not connected to the Internet.</li> <li>Chapter 4 is titled &#x201c;Taking Your Docs to the Next Level: Lists, Tables, and Insertions,&#x201d; and that&#x2019;s precisely what this chapter is about. Create and format bulleted and numbered lists; insert and edit tables, pictures, and links; and create a table of contents.</li> <li>Chapter 5, &#x201c;Sharing and Collaborating on Documents,&#x201d; explains the how-tos of sharing a document with viewers (who can read a document but not make changes to it), collaborators (who can both read and edit a document), or both. If you&#x2019;ve never collaborated on a document in real time before, the chapter explains how that works. Finally, we look at Revision History, which lets you find and compare previous versions of a document&#x2014;a great feature if a collaborator makes changes you don&#x2019;t like.</li> <li>Chapter 6 introduces Google Docs spreadsheets (which is why it&#x2019;s called &#x201c;Introducing Spreadsheets&#x201d;). After a quick discussion of spreadsheet design, the chapter moves right into creating your first spreadsheet in Google Docs. From there it covers spreadsheet templates, formatting, working with multiple sheets, and the basics of working with data.</li> <li>Chapter 7, &#x201c;Spreadsheets: Formulas and Charts,&#x201d; shows you how to power up your spreadsheets using formulas and functions, as well as how to display a spreadsheet&#x2019;s data graphically by creating charts and using gadgets (a gadget is a self-contained mini-program that you can put on a Web page).</li> <li>Chapter 8, &#x201c;Sharing and Collaborating on Spreadsheets,&#x201d; covers such topics as publishing a spreadsheet on the Web, inviting others to view or collaborate on your spreadsheet, creating forms others can use to add data to a spreadsheet, and working with a spreadsheet&#x2019;s revision history.</li> <li>Chapter 9, &#x201c;Introducing Presentations,&#x201d; tells you everything you need to know to create a professional-looking slideshow presentation. The chapter begins with some pointers for designing an effective presentation and then takes you through the steps of creating your first presentation. From there, you learn how to add slides and fill them with elements&#x2014;text, lists, images, shapes, and videos. The chapter discusses how to import individual slides or entire presentations, as well as export a presentation so you can work on it in PowerPoint, print it out, or save it to your computer.</li> <li>Chapter 10, &#x201c;The Main Event: Sharing and Viewing Presentations,&#x201d; covers what presentations are all about&#x2014;sharing them with others. Whether you want to bring others in to help you design the presentation, show the presentation to a live audience, or publish the presentation on the Web, this chapter tells you what you need to know.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p> <b>Note - </b>?Google frequently asks users for feedback and feature requests--and they're almost constantly updating their applications in response. Because of these frequent updates, you may find that some of the pages and steps on the live applications differ from what you see in this book.</p> </blockquote> <p><b>A Word About Security</b></p> <p>If you&#x2019;re used to storing your files locally on your own computer, the idea of &#x201c;cloud computing&#x201d;&#x2014;accessing programs and storing files using the Internet&#x2014;might feel a bit uncomfortable. The question is an important one: Is Google Docs secure?</p> <p>When you create a document in Google Docs, that document and any information in it is private.

He had a little.</p><p>He didn't taint the nymphs' deep home.<br>He dozed off in her lap. He's sleeping still.</p><p>These words, translated from the original Greek by poet and filmmaker Michael Wolfe, mark the passing of a child who died roughly 2,000 years ago.

Avoiding assessments of the Bible&#39;s truth or authority, the authors maintain a rigorously objective tone as they discuss such major issues as the forms and strategies found in biblical writing, the actual historical and physical settings of that writing, the process of canon formation, the sources of the Pentateuch, and the nature of such literary biblical genres as prophecy, apocalypse, and gospel. Each chapter is an independent yet related essay, and the Third Edition has been updated and enhanced by two new chapters: &#34;Ancient Near Eastern Literature and the Bible&#34; and &#34;The Text of the Bible.&#34; In addition, the reading lists following each chapter have been completely updated in order to reflect the most recent scholarship. The result is an easy-to-use, exciting presentation of the art of the Bible that is indispensable to students and accessible to readers of all kinds.</p><p>Charles B. Wheeler, both Emeritus Professors, both at Ohio State University. Anthony D. York, Emeritus Professor of English and Comparative Literature, University of Cincinnati."The 4th edition is the single most useful guide for the undergraduate student to a study of the literature of the old New Testaments, emphasizing critical analysis and forms."--Iris Rozencwajg, Houston Community College<br><br>"A very good book. It is a good general text. My class in OT literature used it along with other readings a year ago and found it helpful. (Since I teach separate OT and NT courses I'd prefer separate texts.)"--Grace C. Cooper, University of D.C.<br><br>Praise for the previous edition (1st 2 quotes): "I am impressed once again with the logic of the organization, the clarity of the writing, and the wonderful balance. The Bible as Literature is still the best introduction to the subject on the market."--David Hirsch, Professor of English and Judaic Studies, Brown University<br><br>"Gabel, Wheeler, and York do an excellent job. They not only provide textual evidence to support their analytical discussion, but also often provide the context and synopsis of the passage--a technique that is key to making the text work with students who are simultaneously reading the Bible for the first time. Accessibility, scholarship, and logical organization make this text easy and worthy to integrate with a course."--Ken Paul Novak, United States Air Force Academy</p><h2>Advanced Accounting</h2><p><p> <i>For undergraduate and graduate courses in advanced accounting. </i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Practical learning and real-world application in accounting</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>Advanced Accounting </i> </b>is an in�-depth guide to accounting that reflects the most up-�to-�date business developments.

Stansbury-O&#39;Donnell, offers a practical guide to the methods for approaching, analyzing, and contextualizing an unfamiliar piece of Greek art. It demonstrates how objects are dated and assigned to an artist or region; how to interpret the subject matter and narrative; how to reconstruct the context for which an object was made, distributed, and used; and how we can explore broader cultural perspectives by looking at questions of identity, gender, and relationships to surrounding cultures. Each section focuses on different theoretical approaches, providing an overview of the theories, key terms, and required evidence. Case studies serve to demonstrate each process and some key issues to consider when using a given approach. This book explores a variety of media, including terracotta, metalwork, and jewelry, in addition to works found in major museum collections in the United States and Europe.</p><p>Mark D. Stansbury-O&#39;Donnell is a professor of art history at the University of St Thomas in St Paul, Minnesota. He is the author of Pictorial Narrative in Ancient Greek Art (Cambridge University Press, 1999) and Vase Painting, Gender, and the Social Identity of Archaic Athens (Cambridge University Press, 2006). He has published in the American Journal of Archaeology and has contributed to several other books on Greek art and vase painting.&#39;Stansbury-O&#39;Donnell&#39;s book will give students of Greek art a good sense of the range of interpretive tools they have at their disposal; it will also, I suspect, help more experienced researchers to identify the weak points in their own mastery of method and theory.&#39; Bryn Mawr Classical Review</p><h2>Rip Van Winkle (Calla Editions)</h2><p>This charming hardcover collectible will appeal to both admirers of N. C. Wyeth&#39;s iconic art and Washington Irving&#39;s timeless tale of the Hudson Valley idler who sleeps for 20 years.

Today these images are recognized as among Rackham's very best works.<br>This edition features all 51 full-page color plates, as well as the full text of Irving's classic tale. And enduring foundation of Catskill lore, the captivating narrative recounts the fanciful adventures of an amiable ne'er-do-well colonial farmer who wanders into the highlands, falls asleep after drinking with a band of strange little mountain men, and wakes twenty years later in a world that has passed him by.<br>Effusing a gentle humor, Rackham's art is a constant reminder of a more innocent era. This edition&#x2014;sure to enchant art lovers&#x2014;will also delight Rackham devotees and fantasy fans alike.</p>The wonderful story of Rip Van Winkle, which is today considered a classic in American literature, was written in 1820 by Washington Irving. About one hundred years later, N.C. Wyeth, one of the United States' greatest illustrators, created for Irving's story the marvelous paintings and drawings that appear in this book.<br>Now come along and meet Rip, his neighbors, and his children?and those mysterious men who play ninepins up in the mountains.</p><h2>Southern Pacific Passenger Trains (Great Trains)</h2><p>Brian Solomon. Well into the 1950s, the Southern Pacific operated an extensive fleet of colorful (a color scheme nicknamed "daylight") and highly-regarded passenger trains that became the preferred mode of travel for the West Coast's nouveau riche film stars and businesspeople.

This book issues a challenge to Western civilization to understand its roots in the faith of the Bible. The growth, corruption and purification of the important Western emphases on individuality are chronicled here insightfully.</p><p><b>Reinhold Niebuhr</b> (1892 - 1971) was an ethicist, theologian, and political philosopher who taught at Union Theological Seminary in New York City from 1928 to 1960. Before that, for thirteen years, he was minister of Detroit's Bethel Evangelical Church.</p><h2>The Lucifer Principle: A Scientific Expedition into the Forces of History</h2><p>The Lucifer Principle is a revolutionary work that explores the intricate relationships between genetics, human behavior, and culture to put forth the thesis that "evil" is a by-product of nature's strategies for creation and that it is woven into our most basic biological fabric.<br>In a sweeping narrative that moves lucidly among sophisticated scientific disciplines and covers the entire span of the earth's, as well as mankind's, history, Howard Bloom challenges some of our most popular scientific assumptions. Drawing on evidence from studies of the most primitive organisms to those on ants, apes, and humankind, the author makes a persuasive case that it is the group, or "superorganism," rather than the lone individual that really matters in the evolutionary struggle. But, Bloom asserts, the prominence of society and culture does not necessarily mitigate against our most violent, aggressive instincts. In fact, under the right circumstances the mentality of the group will only amplify our most primitive and deadly urges.<br>In Bloom's most daring contention he draws an analogy between the biological material whose primordial multiplication began life on earth and the ideas, or "memes," that define, give cohesion to, and justify human superorganisms. Some of the most familiar memes are utopian in nature - Christianity or Marxism; nonetheless, these are fueled by the biological impulse to climb to the top of the hierarchy. With the meme's insatiable hunger to enlarge itself, we have a precise prescription for war.<br>Biology is not destiny; but human culture is not always the buffer to our more primitive instincts we would like to think it is. In these complex threads of thought lies the Lucifer Principle, and only through understanding its mandates will we be able to avoid the nuclear crusades that await us in the twenty-first century.</p><p><p><b>Howard Bloom</b> has debated one-on-one with senior officials from Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Gaza's Hamas on Iran's al-Alam TV. He has dissected headline issues over thirty times on Saudi Arabia's KSA2-TV, Ekhbariya TV, Economics TV, and on Iran's global English-language Press-TV. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubai's ruler, who doubles as the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, has named a racehorse after one of Bloom's books. And Britain's Channel 4 TV says Bloom is the Einstein, Newton, Darwin, and Freud of the twenty-first century.</p><br> A philosophical look at the history of our species which alternated between fascinating and frightening.

Jackson notes that no one has offered a convincing explanation of why Islam spread among Blackamericans (a coinage he explains and defends) but not among white Americans or Hispanics. The assumption has been that there is an African connection. In fact, Jackson shows, none of the distinctive features of African Islam appear in the proto-Islamic, black nationalist movements of the early 20th century. Instead, he argues, Islam owes its momentum to the distinctively American phenomenon of "Black Religion," a God-centered holy protest against anti-black racism.<br>Islam in Black America begins as part of a communal search for tools with which to combat racism and redefine American blackness. The 1965 repeal of the National Origins Quota System led to a massive influx of foreign Muslims, who soon greatly outnumbered the blacks whom they found here practicing an indigenous form of Islam. Immigrant Muslims would come to exercise a virtual monopoly over the definition of a properly constituted Islamic life in America. For these Muslims, the nemesis was not white supremacy, but "the West." In their eyes, the West was not a racial, but a religious and civilizational threat. American blacks soon learned that opposition to the West and opposition to white supremacy were not synonymous. Indeed, says Jackson, one cannot be anti-Western without also being on some level anti-Blackamerican. Like the Black Christians of an earlier era struggling to find their voice in the context of Western Christianity, Black Muslims now began to strive to find their black, American voice in the context of the super-tradition of historical Islam. Jackson argues that Muslim tradition itself contains the resources to reconcile blackness, American-ness, and adherence to Islam. It is essential, he contends, to preserve within Islam the legitimate aspects of Black Religion, in order to avoid what Stephen Carter calls the domestication of religion, whereby religion is rendered incapable of resisting the state and the dominant culture. At the same time, Jackson says, it is essential for Blackamerican Muslims to reject an exclusive focus on the public square and the secular goal of subverting white supremacy (and Arab/immigrant supremacy) and to develop a tradition of personal piety and spirituality attuned to distinctive Blackamerican needs and idiosyncrasies.<br></p><p><br>Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies, The University of Michigan<br>"Destined to become a fixture in any course dealing with Islam in America, Jackson's treatment of the subject offers many helpful insights while giving a voice to often-ignored Blackamerican Muslims. ...his work will contribute to the lively and growing debate over the place of Islam in America and<br>the role of Blackamerican Muslims in the contemporary American religious scene." --The Virginia Quarterly Review<br>"No one has ever analyzed the actual dynamics of Blackamerican Muslims with more acute insight, or more palpable good will, than Sherman Jackson.

He represents the culmination of the Venetian school, evolving a technique of free, spontaneous brushwork and a rendering of form through color that amazed his contemporaries and is now seen by some as foreshadowing Impressionism. In a long life of nearly ninety years he painted hundreds of canvases, ranging from moving and intense religious images, through penetratingly psychological portraits (including Charles V and Philip II of Spain) to sensuously erotic mythological scenes like <i>Bacchus and Ariadne</i> and the <i>Venus of Urbino</i>. Over 250 paintings are now attributed to him. All are illustrated here with detailed commentaries giving the circumstances of their commission, their subsequent history and stylistic analysis.

Cuddon's classic dictionary has been thoroughly revised and updated to maintain it as the most comprehensive and accessible work of its kind currently available, for students, teachers and general readers alike. Expanded to include many new entries, it has been improved throughout, in places rendered more concise, in others amended and extended, with both major and minor additions. The work of the third edition, to cover the schools and various terminologies of literary theory is continued, without compromising coverage afforded to more traditional critical terms and topics. <p>At this untimely death in 1996, Charles Cuddon, as he was known, had completed much of the revisory and updating work involved in preparing the edition. That work and other unfinished plans and outlines have since been overseen and developed by C.E. Preston of Sidney Sussex college, Cambridge, helped, as she acknowledges, by several of her academic colleagues. Among the entries extensively rewritten or newly contributed are:</p> <p><br> </p> <ul> <li>"CrimeFiction",<br> </li> <li>"Dramatic Monologue",<br> </li> <li>"Ellipsis",<br> </li> <li>"Punctuation",<br> </li> <li>"Rhyme",<br> </li> <li>"Verse Novel", and<br> </li> <li>"Sonnet Cycle".</li> <li><br> </li> </ul> <br> After more than twenty years in print, Cuddon's <i>Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory</i> remains "a superlative work of reference that will be read for pleasure", just as it was acclaimed to be when first published in 1976.

The extracts are arranged thematically, dealing with the central areas of medieval women&#39;s lives and their relation to social and cultural institutions. Each section is contextualised with a brief historical introduction, and the materials span literary, historical, theological and other narrative and imaginative writing. The writings here uncover and confound the stereotype of the medieval woman as lady or virgin by demonstrating the different roles and meanings that the sign of woman occupied in the imaginative space of the medieval period. Larrington&#39;s clear and accessible editorial material and the modern English translations of all the extracts mean this work is ideally suited for students. Women and Writing in Early Europe: A Sourcebook also contains an extensive and fully up-to-date bibliography, making it not only essential reading for undergraduates and post graduates but also a valuable tool for scholars.</p><p></p><h2>Organismic evolution</h2><p>Owner name on end page.

The Story of Elmyr de Hory, the Greatest Art Forger of Our Time</h2><p>FAKE! : The Story of Elmyr de Hory, the Greatest Art Forger of Our Time [Hardcover]</p><p></p><h2>The Warhol Economy: How Fashion, Art, and Music Drive New York City - New Edition</h2><p><p>Which is more important to New York City's economy, the gleaming corporate office--or the grungy rock club that launches the best new bands? If you said "office," think again. In <i>The Warhol Economy</i>, Elizabeth Currid argues that creative industries like fashion, art, and music drive the economy of New York as much as--if not more than--finance, real estate, and law. And these creative industries are fueled by the social life that whirls around the clubs, galleries, music venues, and fashion shows where creative people meet, network, exchange ideas, pass judgments, and set the trends that shape popular culture.</p><br><p> The implications of Currid's argument are far-reaching, and not just for New York. Urban policymakers, she suggests, have not only seriously underestimated the importance of the cultural economy, but they have failed to recognize that it depends on a vibrant creative social scene. They haven't understood, in other words, the social, cultural, and economic mix that Currid calls the Warhol economy.</p><br><p> With vivid first-person reporting about New York's creative scene, Currid takes the reader into the city spaces where the social and economic lives of creativity merge. The book has fascinating original interviews with many of New York's important creative figures, including fashion designers Zac Posen and Diane von Furstenberg, artists Ryan McGinness and Futura, and members of the band Clap Your Hands Say Yeah.</p><br><p> The economics of art and culture in New York and other cities has been greatly misunderstood and underrated. <i>The Warhol Economy</i> explains how the cultural economy works-and why it is vital to all great cities.</p></p><p><p>"Elizabeth Currid's hip trip through New York's production of creative culture is a tour de force."<b>--Quincy Jones, producer</b></p><p>"I've uttered the words 'It just kind of happened' with a shrug hundreds of times when asked about the quick success of my band. Elizabeth Currid blows that lazy response to smithereens by showing the work behind 'word of mouth.' I think I'll have a better answer now."<b>--Lee Sargent, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah</b></p><p>"The old economy made deals over golf games and three-martini lunches. Creative New York organizes its networks around art openings, fashion shows, and nightlife. But these networks are a lot more than fun and games. They are deeply important to how new innovations are produced, how cities work to sustain creativity and turn it into commercial value. Cities drive our economies; creativity drives our cities. With her keen eye, sharp analysis, and detailed fieldwork, Elizabeth Currid shows us why and how. In <i>The Warhol Economy</i>, she has unlocked the best-kept secrets in New York."<b>--Richard Florida, author of <i>The Rise of the Creative Class</i></b></p><p>"Elizabeth Currid's <i>The Warhol Economy</i> raises distinctive policy implications: namely, cities will get bigger payoffs by supporting milieu rather than museum. Laws that hurt the clubs are almost as bad as the rising rents that price-out the artists. Tax breaks to corporations make no sense whatever. Currid is more than plausible on all these issues."<b>--Harvey Molotch, New York University</b></p><p>"Elizabeth Currid has written a wonderful book. She shows that the arts and culture are not simply 'service industries.' Examining arts and culture in New York for the understanding they provide about deeper changes in our world, Currid addresses fundamental sociological issues while also engaging the general reader--with clarity, insight, humor, and passion. The reader feels taken along to the offices and nightclubs where some of the most creative people in New York gather."<b>--Terry Clark, University of Chicago</b></p><b>Elizabeth Currid</b> is an assistant professor at the University of Southern California's School of Policy, Planning, and Development.

With a masterful eye for the telling detail, Knox continually reminds us that we share the present with antiquity's living past. A soldier in Italy finds a battered book in the rubble of a bombed-out firehouse-- and opens it to read Virgil's denunciation of war. An illiterate Greek bard composes a garbled Homeric song to celebrate the recent heroism of local partisans. A traveler heading north from modern Athens must choose between the Sacred Way-- or the NATO Road. <p>Whether the subject is the role of women in ancient Athens or the novelists of modern Italy, the wit and erudition of Bernard Knox never fail to instruct and delight. Now in paperback, "Essays Ancient and Modern" takes it place alongside the distinguished essays of Knox's "Word and Action", a book whose title brings together, in the words of Anthony Hecht, "the double strand of his admirable career".</p></p><p>Knox is a noted classics scholar whose essays on Greek literature keep a nice balance between the claims of history and of art, between the discipline of research and the rights of interpretation. Most of his other subjects here come either from literary England or from the Spanish Civil War and World War II. The tragic destinies of nations, warriors, and kings run through this book in a dark undercurrent. Though many of the essays are lengthy book reviews, often full of scholarly dispute, the book as a whole reaches for a wider public of history lovers who will find rich resources here.<br><i>- Donald Ray, Mercy Coll.

It covers the English parliament from its origins, the pre-1707 Scottish parliament and the pre-1800 Irish parliament, the parliament of Great Britain from 1707 and the parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801, together with sections on the post-devolution parliaments and assemblies set up in the 1990s and on parliaments in the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and the Irish Republic. It considers all aspects of parliament as an institution: membership of both the Lords and the Commons; constituencies, elections and franchises; where the Lords and the Commons met; how business was arranged and managed, including Speakers, the use of committees, the development of parties, lobbying and voting procedures; legal cases in the House of Lords; official recording of and reporting of business and debates; the conflict and balance of power between the two Houses; and the position of the monarch in parliament. Each section contains a chronology listing key events, suggestions for further reading and &#34;inserts&#34; - short anecdotes or accounts of particular figures or episodes which provide lively illustrations of parliament at work in different periods.

Widely used throughout the world, this book will continue to serve as the standard English-language dictionary of epidemiology in its Fourth Edition. It covers all the common terms used in epidemiology and many from related fields such as biostatistics, infectious disease control, health promotion, genetics, clinical epidemiology, health economics, and medical ethics. The definitions are clear and concise, but there is space for some brief essays and discussions of the provenance of important terms.

Explores the fundamentals of most types of internal combustion engines with a major emphasis on reciprocating engines. Covers both spark ignition and compression ignition engines as well as those operating on four-stroke cycles and on two-stroke cycles ranging in size from small model airplane engines to the larger stationary engines. Examines recent advancements, such as, Miller cycle analysis, lean burn engines, 2-stroke cycle automobile engines, variable valve timing, and thermal storage.</p><p>This applied thermoscience text covers the basic principles and applications of various types of internal combustion engines.<p> The goal of the second edition of this book is the same as that of the first edition, with updated material in several areas that reflects the ever-advancing technology of internal combustion engines. This book was written to be used as an applied thermoscience textbook in a one-semester, college-level, undergraduate engineering course on internal combustion engines. It provides the material needed for a basic understanding of the operation of internal combustion engines. Students are assumed to have knowledge of fundamental thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics as a prerequisite to get maximum benefit from the text. This book can also be used for self-study or as a reference book in the field of engines. </p> <p> Contents include the fundamentals of most types of internal combustion engines, with a major emphasis on reciprocating engines. Both spark ignition and compression ignition engines are covered, as are those operating on four-stroke cycles and on two-stroke cycles, and ranging in size from small model airplane engines to the largest stationary engines. Rocket engines and jet engines are not included. Because of the large number of engines that are used in automobiles and other vehicles, a major emphasis is placed on these. </p> <p> The book is divided into 11 chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 give an introduction, terminology, definitions, and basic operating characteristics. These are followed in Chapter 3 with detailed analysis of basic engine cycles. Chapter 4 reviews fundamental thermochemistry as it applies to engine operation and engine fuels. Chapters 5 through 9 follow the air-fuel charge as it passes sequentially through an engine, including intake, motion within a cylinder, combustion, exhaust, and emissions. Engine heat transfer, friction, and lubrication are covered in Chapters 10 and 11. Each chapter includes solved example problems and historical notes, followed by a set of unsolved review problems. Also included at the end of each chapter are open-ended problems that require limited design application, in keeping with the modern engineering education trend of emphasizing design through the entire curriculum. These design problems can be used as minor weekly exercises or as major group projects. </p> <p> Fueled by intensive commercial competition and increasingly strict government regulations on emissions and safety, the field of engine technology is constantly changing. It is difficult to stay knowledgeable about all advancements in engine design, materials, controls, and fuel development that we experience at an ever-increasing rate. During the years as the outline for this text evolved, continuous changes were required as new developments occurred. Those advancements that are covered in this book include tie Miller cycle, lean burn engines, hybrid vehicles, 42-volt electrical systems, variable valve timing, fuel cell technology, gasoline direct injection, variable compression ratios, cylinder cutout, thermal storage, etc. Advancements and technological changes will continue to occur, and further updating of this text will be required periodically. </p> <p> Information in the book represents an accumulation of general material collected by the author over a period of years while teaching courses and working in research and development in the field of internal combustion engines in the Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. During this time, information has been collected from many sources, including conferences, newspapers, personal communication, books, technical periodicals, research, product literature, television, etc. This information became the basis for the outline and notes used in the teaching of a class about internal combustion engines. These class notes, in turn, evolved into the general outline for this textbook. A list of references from the technical literature from which specific information for this book was taken is included at the back of the book. Several references were of special importance in the development of these notes and are suggested for additional reading and more in-depth study. For keeping up with information about the latest research and development in automobile and internal combustion engine technology, publications by SAE International (Society of Automotive Engineers) are highly recommended; reference ll is very good. For general information about most engine subjects, references 40, 58, 93,100,116 are recommended. On certain subjects, some of these references go into too much depth to be manageable in a one-semester course. Some of the information is slightly out of date, but overall, these are very informative references. For historical information about engines and automobiles in general, references 29, 45, 97, 102 are suggested. General data, formulas, and principles of engineering thermodynamics and heat transfer are used at various places throughout the text. Most undergraduate textbooks on these subjects would supply the needed information. References 63, 90 were used by the author. </p> <p> In preparing this second edition, the author has followed the suggestions for improvements made by reviewers, when possible. Following the suggestion made by several reviewers, many more data dealing with real engines are included, using the actual figures from technical literature when possible. </p> <p> In keeping with the trend of the world, the international system of units (SI) are used throughout the book, often supplemented with English units. Most research and development of engines is done using SI units, and this is reflected in the technical literature. The consumer market, however, still commonly uses English units, such as horsepower, miles per gallon, and cubic inch displacement, particularly in the automobile market. A conversion table of SI and English units for common parameters used in engine work is included in the appendix at the back of the book. </p> <p> The reader should remember that many of the mathematical formulas used in this book and other technical literature are only models of what is actually happening. Often these are simplified models of very complex occurrences (e.g., chemical reactions, engine cycles, flow in cylinders, etc.). These models often allow us to relate important variables and solve many technical problems, but should not be used beyond their intended range. </p> <p> We have entered an exciting revolutionary period of internal combustion engine technology, largely brought about by the use of computer controls. For over 100 years, most combustion engines operated on the same basic four-stroke Otto or Diesel cycles. These engines had a fixed displacement, a fixed compression ratio, and fixed valve actuation controlled with a camshaft. The major improvement experienced during this time was higher thermal efficiency, brought about by better fuels and higher compression ratios. Now at the start of the twenty-first century, we suddenly have engines with variable displacement, variable compression ratios, variable valve control, and other technological advancements; and we have computer power to control these variables. The challenge to today's automobile and engine engineers is to develop new engine concepts that utilize and optimize these new technologies. We must understand the basic concepts, but we must not limit ourselves to evolutionary improvements of these concepts. </p> <p> The author would like to express his gratitude to the many people who have influenced him and helped in the writing of this book. First, I thank Dorothy, who was always there, along with John, Tim, Becky, and Chad. I thank the people who reviewed the original book manuscript of the first edition, and those who reviewed the book in preparation of this second edition. The suggestions for additions and improvements that these people made have resulted in a better text. Although I have never met them, I am indebted to authors J. B. Heywood, C. R. Ferguson, E. F. Obert, and R. Stone. The books these men have written about internal combustion engines have certainly influenced the content of this textbook. I thank my father, who many years ago introduced me to the field of automobiles and generated a lifelong interest. I thank Earl of Capital City Auto Electric for carrying on the tradition. </p> <p> WILLARD W PULKRABEK<br> <i>University of Wisconsin-Platteville</i> </p></p><h2>A Century of Communication Studies: The Unfinished Conversation</h2><p><p>This volume chronicles the development of communication studies as a discipline, providing a history of the field and identifying opportunities for future growth.

William Davies King, on the other hand, has devoted decades to collecting nothing&#x2014;and a lot of it. With <i>Collections of Nothing</i>, he takes a hard look at this habitual hoarding to see what truths it can reveal about the impulse to accumulate.</p> <p>Part memoir, part reflection on the mania of acquisition, <i>Collections of Nothing</i> begins with the stamp collection that King was given as a boy. In the following years, rather than rarity or pedigree, he found himself searching out the lowly and the lost, the cast-off and the undesired: objects that, merely by gathering and retaining them, he could imbue with meaning, even value. As he relates the story of his burgeoning collections, King also offers a fascinating meditation on the human urge to collect. This wry, funny, even touching appreciation and dissection of the collector&#x2019;s art as seen through the life of a most unusual specimen will appeal to anyone who has ever felt the unappeasable power of that acquisitive fever.</p> <p>"What makes this book, bred of a midlife crisis, extraordinary is the way King weaves his autobiography into the account of his collection, deftly demonstrating that the two stories are essentially one. . . . His hard-won self-awareness gives his disclosures an intensity that will likely resonate with all readers, even those whose collections of nothing contain nothing at all."&#x2014;<i>New Yorker</i></p> <p>"King's extraordinary book is a memoir served up on the backs of all things he collects. . . .

William Davies King is a theater professor who over his fifty-plus years has gathered, in countless binders and boxes, a vast collection of things nobody else wants: cat-food labels, chain letters, skeleton keys, cereal boxes, chopstick wrappers, the "Place Stamp Here" squares from the corners of envelopes. It's an obsession you might think was inexplicable--least of all by the one obsessed--but in <em>Collections of Nothing</em> King makes his mania seem nearly rational, and the personal drama of it wryly fascinating. (Imagine if Henry Darger had written witty, self-aware essays that analyzed his obsessions without puncturing their mystery.) King is an academic and he's been through therapy, but he writes free of the clots and cliches of both of those disciplines, contemplating what he calls "the cumbersummation of me" with the myopic elegance of Nicholson Baker and a moving understanding that this strange, apparently worthless collection--and now this lovely and wise book about it--are what he has to offer the world. <em>--Tom Nissley</em><b>William Davies King </b>has explored numerous odd corners of theater history in books and articles, including <i>Henry Irving&#x2019;s &#x201c;Waterloo&#x201d;</i>, which won the Joe A. Calloway Prize. He is professor in the Department of Theater and Dance at University of California, Santa Barbara.</p><h2>The Woman in White (Dover Giant Thrift Editions)</h2><p>Mistaken identities, locked rooms, madness, and romance&#x2014;these are a few of the ingredients the author (one of the most successful and popular Victorian writers) used to inspire "the 'creepy' effect, as of pounded ice dropped down the back," that, according to one of his friends, was Wilkie Collins's aim in writing <i>The Woman in White</i>. Popularly regarded as one of the author's finest works, and widely copied by other writers, this thriller was the prototype for a whole new genre of fiction: the "sensation novel."<br>A scheming nobleman, a beautiful heiress, and, of course, the enigmatic woman in white&#x2014;a mysterious figure confined to an asylum for the insane&#x2014;are the featured players in an intricate, compelling story that was acclaimed by Henry James and T. S. Eliot. An instant success when it first appeared in 1860, the riveting tale has continued to enthrall readers ever since.</p><p>"There in the middle of the broad, bright high-road-there, as if it had that moment sprung out of the earth or dropped from the heaven-stood the figure of a solitary woman, dressed from head to foot in white garments." Thus young Walter Hartright first meets the mysterious woman in white in what soon became one of the most popular novels of the nineteenth century. Secrets, mistaken identities, surprise revelations, amnesia, locked rooms and locked asylums, and an unorthodox villain made this mystery thriller an instant success when it first appeared in 1860, and it has continued to enthrall readers ever since. From the hero's foreboding before his arrival at Limmeridge House to the nefarious plot concerning the beautiful Laura, the breathtaking tension of Collin's narrative created a new literary genre of suspense fiction, which profoundly shaped the course of English popular writing. Collins other great mystery, <i>The Moonstone</i>, has been called the finest detective story ever written, but it was this work that so gripped the imagination of the world that Wilkie Collins had his own tombstone inscribed: "Author of <i>The Woman In White</i>. . . "As the inscription on his tombstone reveals, Wilkie Collins wanted to be remembered as the &#34;author of The Woman in White,&#34; for it was this novel that secured his reputation during his lifetime. The novel begins with a drawing teacher&#39;s eerie late-night encounter with a mysterious woman in white, and then follows his love for Laura Fairlie, a young woman who is falsely incarcerated in an asylum by her husband, Sir Percival Glyde, and his sinister accomplice, Count Fosco. This edition returns to the original text that galvanized England when it was published in serial form in All the Year Round magazine in 1860. Three different prefaces Collins wrote for the novel, as well as two of his essays on the book&#39;s composition, are reprinted, along with nine illustrations. The appendices include contemporary reviews, along with essays on lunacy, asylums, mesmerism, and the rights of women.</p><h2>A Textbook for Heat Transfer Fundamentals</h2><p>Heat transfer background is becoming vital for scientists and engineers in several branches of technological development, including mechanical, chemical, electrical, materials, environmental, civil, aerospace and bio engineering, and further expanding into biosciences, material science, chemistry and physics. The purpose of this textbook is to teach undergraduate students the fundamentals of heat transfer within one semester without their becoming overwhelmed with the details or with mathematical complications. The intent is to introduce the physical principals and fundamental concepts of heat transfer efficiently and effectively and to develop the skills to identify basic problems in various applications and seek their solutions. One of the objectives of this book is to engage students to read and comprehend concepts without difficulty. The book makes an effort to introduce basic concepts of heat transfer using simple language making them easy to understand. Students are exposed to many challenging interruptions during the school years, so rather than having them struggle with difficult and puzzling explanations they are led to focus on important essentials. The aim was not to produce a thick book with excessive reference information and derivations. Rather, it was to teach almost all material included in the chapters. Today in academic society students are exposed to large amounts of electronic information and in general they do not have the time to read thick textbooks. Several excellent graduate level textbooks, reference books and web sites are available on specific topics. Students can access these resources by simply searching each topic presented in the book to further enhance knowledge.</p><p>Yildiz Bayazitoglu, Rice University, USA.Necati M.

It is most suited for a one semester organic chemistry course. In an attempt to highlight the relevance of the material to students, the authors place a strong emphasis on showing the interrelationship between organic chemistry and other areas of science, particularly the biological and health sciences. The text illustrates the use of organic chemistry as a tool in these sciences; it also stresses the organic compounds, both natural and synthetic, that surround us in everyday life: in pharmaceuticals, plastics, fibers, agrochemicals, surface coatings, toiletry preparations and cosmetics, food additives, adhesives, and elastomers.</p><p><b>The flower of the passion fruit,</b> <i>Passiflora edulis,</i> showing 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry in its styles and stamen, respectively. Symmetry and the lack of symmetry are important features of organic molecules. For example, a fascinating distinction between the yellow and purple passion fruit was found when studying compounds occurring within the species. 2-Heptanol, for example, is found in both the yellow and purple passion fruit but, whereas the R&nbsp;enantiomer predominates in purple fruit (92%), the S enantiomer predominates in yellow fruit (82%). Just as the passion fruit and its' flower illustrate important concepts at work in organic chemistry, this text enables students to make the connections between organic chemistry in the classroom and the world around them.<b>William H.

The period 1763-1810 was a crucial and distinctive stage in the colonial history of Mexico. Jose de G�lvez, the dynamic minister of the Indies, transformed the system of government and restructured the economy. The ensuing &#39;golden age&#39;, far from being the culmination of two hundred years of steady development, sprang rather from a profound regeneration of the New World&#39;s Hispanic society. The chief success of G�lvez&#39;s policy was the unprecedented mining boom which made Mexico the world&#39;s chief silver producer. It was this silver boom which largely financed the revival of the political and economic power of the Spanish monarchy and, in Mexico itself, created a new aristocracy of merchant capitalists and silver millionaires.</p><p>The aim of this study is to define that distinctive blend of enlightened despotism and entrepreneurial talent which created Bourbon Mexico.

Yet how she achieved this legendary status is just one of several stories of her remarkable and unexpected life.</strong></p> Inspired by the twenty-three "tales," Matthew Dennison takes a selection of quotations from Potter's stories and uses them to explore her multi-faceted life and character: repressed Victorian daughter; thwarted lover; artistic genius; formidable countrywoman. They chart her transformation from a young girl with a love of animals and fairy tales into a bestselling author and canny businesswoman, so deeply unusual for the Victorian era in which she grew up. Embellished with photographs of Potter's life and her own illustrations, this biography will delight anyone who has been touched by Beatrix Potter's work. <ul><li>For the fans of her children&#x2019;s literature who want to know the real-life animals behind Mrs. Tiggy Winkle, Jemima Puddle duck, and of course, Peter Rabbit.<br></li></ul> 8 pages of color illustrations</p><p>Matthew Dennison is the author of several critically acclaimed works of non-fiction, including Over the Hills and Far Away: The Life of Beatrix Potter, also available from Pegasus Books. He is a contributor to Country Life&nbsp;and lives in the United Kingdom.&#x201c;[Potter is] arguably the most popular English children&#x2019;s book author of all time, and the subject of Matthew Dennison&#x2019;s excellent short biography. The book is concise, brisk, and consistently interesting, offering just enough detail for most readers.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Michael Dirda, Barnes &amp; Noble Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Dennison is the latest to turn the story of Beatrix Potter herself into a book. Indeed, Ms. Potter&#x2019;s extraordinary life makes for an absorbing tale. Dennison ably tells about Potter&#x2019;s cloistered childhood; about her determination to get published, and about her marriage to an attorney. Readers feel her passion for England&#x2019;s beautiful Lake District, which became her home. There is much to like about Dennison&#x2019;s version of Potter&#x2019;s life. Dennison skillfully weaves Beatrix&#x2019;s stories into every part of her narrative.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Christian Science Monitor</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In a concise but revealing biography, Dennison brings [Potter&#x2019;s] years to life with empathy and understanding. With perception of thought, elegance of prose and love of subject, Dennison studies the woman and her work, and in so doing gives devotees of both ample reason to delight in her&#x2015;and his&#x2015;work.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Richmond Times-Dispatch</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Lively and succinct. Anyone with even a passing acquaintance with Peter Rabbit and his friends should be intrigued to view them as the means by which Potter found her way out into the wider world.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Potter described her stories as giving 'pleasure without ugliness.' The same can be said of this respectful biography.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Dennison makes strong connections between Potter&#x2019;s life and themes in classic [Potter] titles. As an introduction to the life of Beatrix Potter, Dennison&#x2019;s telling is more than adequate.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In exploring the life of Beatrix Potter, Dennison combines literary criticism with biography.

Having studied motherhood "as if for an exam," reality proved "wilder and deeper and funnier" than anything she'd anticipated.<em>Tender Hooks</em> is Fennelly's spirited exploration of parenting, with all its contradictions and complexities.</p><p>Beth Ann Fennelly is the author of three poetry collections, Unmentionables, Tender Hooks, and Open House; two memoirs, Heating &amp; Cooling and Great with Child; and a novel, The Tilted World, coauthored with her husband, Tom Franklin. She teaches at the University of Mississippi, and is also the state&#x2019;s Poet Laureate. She lives in Oxford, Mississippi.Move over, Sharon Olds, and make way, Denise Duhamel! Fennelly is a southern poet who writes of her own female experience as carnally, or, perhaps, incarnationally, as either of those northerners. If she is not as harrowing as Olds, whose reports of interfamilial violence can be hair-raising, or as hilarious as Duhamel, who seems frequently to have no shame, she is hardly reticent. Formally, she favors single poems and sequences longer than two pages, she seldom rhymes or constructs metered stanzas, her sense of where to break a line is as good as the late Denise Levertov's, she writes striking epigrams (e.g., "First Day at Daycare": "My daughter comes home smelling like / another woman's perfume"), and she often proceeds directly from the title into the body of a poem, as if the title were the first line. She writes primarily about the birth and infancy-to-toddlerhood of her daughter, secondarily about the loss of a previous daughter to miscarriage. She puts the physical realities of the mother-child bond--the touches, smells, sounds, and phenomena--into her poems with an ease that overrides queasiness (still, many men may blanch at her frank detail), relaying the experience of motherhood, including the emotional pain of miscarriage, more convincingly and intimately than any other poet who comes to mind. This is awesome, humanely humbling poetry. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

While studying at Stanford, he was introduced to modernism and symbolism; Mallarm�&#x2019;s dictum, &#x201c;To paint, not the thing, but the effect it provides,&#x201d; would prove essential in Motherwell&#x2019;s work. <i>Elegy to the Spanish Republic</i> is perhaps the most literal example of this influence.

Individually, Jake Adam York&#x2019; s poems are elegies for individuals; collectively, they consider the violence of a racist culture and the determination to resist that racism.<b> </b><br><br>York follows Sun Ra, a Birmingham jazz musician whose response to racial violence was to secede from planet Earth, considers the testimony in the trial of J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant for the murder of Emmet Till in 1955, and recreates events of Selma, Alabama, in 1965. Throughout the collection, an invasion of starlings images<b> </b>the racial hatred and bloodshed. While the 1950s spawned violence, the movement in the early 1960s transformed the language of brutality and turned the violence against the violent, says York. So, the starlings, first produced by violence, become instruments of resistance. <br><br>York&#x2019; s collection responds to and participates in<b> </b>recent movement<b>s</b> to find and punish the perpetrators of the crimes that defined the civil rights movement. <i>A Murmuration of Starlings</i> participates in the search for justice, satisfaction, and closure. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br></p><p><p><b>Jake Adam York </b>is an associate professor of English at the University of ColoradoDenver.

York was raised in northeast Alabama.</p>&#x201c;<i>A Murmuration of Starlings</i>, is a fierce, beautiful, necessary book. Fearless in their reckoning, these poems resurrect contested histories and show us that the past&#x2014;with its troubled beauty, its erasures, and its violence&#x2014;weighs upon us all . . . a murmuration so that we don't forget, so that no one disappears into history.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Natasha Trethewey</b>, Pulitzer-Prize winning author of <i>Native Guard</i><br><br>&#x201c;Through a ceremony of language and song, <i>A Murmuration of Starlings</i> consecrates and memorializes the souls, blood, and bones of those black men and women slaughtered on the altar of hate and violence during the Civil Rights era. With a lucid, shrewd intelligence and a commanding vision of healing and atonement, Jake Adam York makes an offering of images and music that seems the foundation of a new understanding and remembrance. <i>A Murmuration of Starlings</i> is a joyful experience and fulfillment of American verse from one of its most important young poets.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Major Jackson</b>, author of <i>Leaving Saturn</i> and <i>Hoops</i><br><i><br></i>&#x201c;Each poem reaches out&#x2014;as only poems can reach&#x2014;and touches history on its shoulder. We may have thought we knew these stories. But, having been tapped by a homegrown kind of prodigal music&#x2014;something double-edged, call it jazz&#x2014;what turns to face us in these poems is turning toward us for the first time.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Ed Pavlic</b>, author of <i>Labors Lost Left Unfinished</i> and <i>Paraph of Bone and Other Kinds of Blue</i><br><br><br><br><p>I remember the bulletin: an Eastern Airlines commuter prop-jet had crashed into Boston Harbor after take-off from Logan Airport, less than ten miles from our house. I was ten years old. A little research shows that the date was October 4, 1960; the accident occurred around 5:45 p.m., and I would have been watching the six o&#x2019;clock news with my grandfather before dinner. Most startling was the macabre fact that the plane had flown into a huge flock&#x2015;a murmuration&#x2015;of starlings, as many as ten thousand birds. Sixty-two passengers died, making this the worst aviation disaster caused by &#x201c;bird strike.&#x201d; More digging: the website This Day in the 1960s reports that another headline on that day was, &#x201c;A new survey has found that Negroes are getting more higher-level federal jobs.&#x201d;</p><p>Jake Adam York begins his second book of poems, <i>A Murmuration of Starlings</i>, by immediately confronting its looming subject, the still fresh history of violence during the Civil Rights era. But it begins with an altogether different story. In 1890 an avid but naive naturalist named Eugene Schieffelin let loose sixty starlings in Central Park; the next year another forty were uncaged, also imported from Europe. Schieffelin&#x2019;s goal (he had already introduced the house sparrow) was to make it possible for Americans to experience the types of birds mentioned by Shakespeare. &#x201c;Shall Be Taught to Speak,&#x201d; the opening poem, is titled after a line about a starling from <i>Henry IV</i>, Part One, and it concludes:<br></p><p>A thousand miles away, in Arkansas,<br>six men pose beneath a tree. In the photograph,</p><p>the hanged man&#x2019;s sweater&#x2019;s buttoned tight,<br>his hat, his head raked to hide the noose.</p><p>One man stills the body with his cane.<br>Another moves to point, but his arm is blurred.</p><p>Trees burn quietly in the morning sun.<br>Their jaws are set. Just one thing&#x2019;s in motion.</p><p>The thing in motion is a starling. It must be; otherwise the Schieffelin prelude has no purpose. But there is a second thing moving: the arm is blurred. Something dark, breeding, and uncontrollable has been set upon an undefiled continent. The starlings &#x201c;swallow // all the country&#x2019;s wandering songs / then speak their horrors from the eaves.&#x201d;</p><p>In a short endnote, York writes:</p><p><i>A Murmuration of Starlings</i> is part of an ongoing project to<br>elegize and memorialize the martyrs of the Civil Rights<br>movement, whose names are inscribed on the stone table of <br>the Civil Rights Memorial that stands today outside the <br>Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama.</p><p>But the great elegies are living things that gather their own forces for their own purposes. As for memory, it is the steady source of poetry, but also protean, selective, and suspect. This takes us to the sizable challenge facing the poet whose mission is sanctified and sanctioned in advance, his materials clarified by historians and journalists. Before writing a word, he knows the work is preapproved for its intent. How will he go about making something <i>new</i> out of this? The names are inscribed in stone, but poetry is made of more fugitive stuff that likes to escape the confines of the didactic and the resolved. Imprisoned, poetry prefers a hunger strike, the more to enhance its and the reader&#x2019;s misery.</p><p>To allow the book to breathe and the reader to stay engaged, York relies on a few strategies, competently handled. Tonally, he offers variation, however narrow, between an uninflected, smoothly-paced narration of descriptive fact (as in the first poem) and the interruptive voice of an obsessed clairvoyant who conjures up the ghosts of betrayal, hatred, blood lust and murder. An infamous story is always being told, but the voice fluctuates between a trance-like recalling of impressions (like a felon under sodium pentathol) and a less involved but solemn observer.</p><p>The poems&#x2019; forms and shapes then vary according to the degree of stability or repressed emotion in the voice, but compression rules throughout. York knows his material arrives loaded with decades of accumulated sentiment, so he scrupulously avoids irony and digression. <i>A Murmuration of Starlings</i> repeatedly delivers us to a single destination and effect, but the ordering of the poems and sequences, based on the series of stories he tells, diffuses or at least camouflages the predictability of the reader&#x2019;s experience.<br></p><p>For Reverend James Reeb<br>9 March 1965, Selma, Alabama<br></p><p>The ministers rise from empty plates<br>like the steam of chicken and greens</p><p>and puff into coats, into prayers, and then<br>the unlit streets, ready for tomorrow&#x2019;s march</p><p>or gathering or prayers, and then the dark<br>is beating <i>Hey niggers</i> though only their coats are black</p><p>and the night and everything so they cannot see<br>what&#x2019;s coming, what hits them, what feet, what pipes</p><p>at their ribs, who&#x2019;s saying <i>Now you know,</i><br><i>now you know what it&#x2019;s like to be a real nigger</i></p><p>and no one can see what lands, what cracks<br>the skull, the hairline fracture in tangled hair,</p><p>what&#x2019;s nesting, what&#x2019;s beating there,<br>what wings are gathering in his eyes.</p><p>Opening the book&#x2019;s third section, this perfect poem repeats the gestures of &#x201c;Shall be Taught to Speak&#x201d;: the eyes peer at the damage, the details register in high relief, the grief is harnessed. The starlings reappear in conclusion. (When the ministers rise like steam and &#x201c;puff into their coats,&#x201d; should I be thinking of starlings?) In a book so determinedly descriptive of the horrible facts of historical incident, the starlings inject an element both disjunctive and complementary. In flight beyond symbolism, the birds tell us why these stories must be retold. There is history, and there is the force that revisits and reanimates it. That force is embodied in York&#x2019;s starlings&#x2015;and in poetry, Jake Adam York, and every reader of this book. The dark urge still seethes in the present. <i>A Murmuration of Starlings</i>, celebrated for its consecrations, is stained with the profane, even as it reaches for the sacred, as true art always is and does.</p><p>It may seem, then, that York is writing from a position of stiff moral rectitude, but the birds say otherwise. The poems place so much historical material in the foreground and so stubbornly squelch the identity of the speaker(s) that it becomes all too easy for the reader to confuse the subject matter with the content. The latter is what we discover in the former. York may be praised for his selection of and mission to preserve his subject, but the work should be admired for what it accomplishes under the intense pressure it puts on itself and the restrictions it operates within. <i>A Murmuration of Starlings</i>, as York says, is an ongoing project, and the goal is not only difficult to attain, but perhaps unachievable. By lingering over the brutal facts, harshly reimagined, do we see into our natures as bystanders? Is this the way in?</p><p>I haven&#x2019;t quoted from York&#x2019;s longer, fragmented sequences, which here require more introductory context than I wish to linger on. But consider this poem, &#x201c;Watch,&#x201d; dated &#x201c;1965&#x201d;:</p><p>Haze laced with crow, the sky<br>marbles darker, slow negative<br>to Montgomery&#x2019;s gleam.<br>Now the governor feels<br>the imminence, breath filling<br>the highways as shadows<br>gather into storm, miles<br>and miles of protest, columns<br>slowly filing into town.<br>Coalescing, what he can&#x2019;t forget,<br>Selma&#x2019;s tear-gas fog, the riot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>of bodies tangled in that white,<br>wounds, scars unfolding.<br>Now the clouds are pulsing,<br>dark as a plague of starlings.<br>When the first thunder cracks,<br>he smells the rain already.<br>Black water pearls the eaves.</p><p>The weight of history, the bloody chapter in the Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights marches, fail to crush the poem. (The third attempt on March 21, 1965, made it to the state capitol, under the protection of a federalized National Guard and court order; Jimmy Lee Jackson, to whom the title poem is dedicated, was killed in Marion on February 18 in the aftermath of a voting-rights protest while protecting his mother from attack.) York insists that we experience the darkening fate of those days through the eyes of the governor, dispassionately, with malice aforethought, keeping dry under the eaves. The smell of approaching rain becomes as familiar as the odor of tear gas. But regard that last line again, &#x201c;Black water pearls the eaves.&#x201d; Will you agree that it gathers in everything that precedes it, the storm of protest, rain and retribution, the pearly eyes of black starlings? That it is beautiful as well as foreboding? The line contains, in an ultimate condensation, everything York attempts and demands: We cannot risk passing by the beauty of even this ominous encounter with memory.</p><p>It is estimated that there are now more than two hundred million starlings in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> (Ron Slate <i>Blackbird</i> 2008-11-14)</p><h2>Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly (Mary Flexner Lectures of Bryn Mawr College)</h2><p><p>A <i>Times Higher Education</i> Book of the Week</p><p>Judith Butler elucidates the dynamics of public assembly under prevailing economic and political conditions, analyzing what they signify and how.

The book should be read by anyone interested in political science, human rights, social activism, critical theory, gender studies, socio-legal studies and philosophy, as well as those who themselves are part of contemporary movements. (Alexis Bushnell <i>LSE Review of Books</i>)<br><br>Butler&#x2019;s book is everything that a book about our planet in the 21st century should be. It does not turn its back on the circumstances of the material world or give any succour to those who wish to view the present (and the future) through the lens of fantasies about the transformative possibilities offered by conventional politics... Butler demonstrates a clear engagement with an aspect of the world that is becoming in many political contexts almost illicit to discuss: the idea that capitalism, certainly in its neoliberal form, is failing to provide a liveable life for the majority of human beings. The rhetorical question that Butler asks at the conclusion to her introduction&#x2015;of how we might act together when we live in worlds in which so many forms of solidarity are diminishing&#x2015;is a central question for politics throughout the world. (Mary Evans <i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>Conceptually rich... Writing in response to the powerful wave of mass movements whose defining characteristic often involves people sitting or standing in the same place&#x2015;Gezi Park, Tahrir Square, Occupy, etc.&#x2015;Butler argues that freedom of assembly is an inextricable part of freedom of expression. And freedom of assembly is coming under increasing assault, in part because the very spaces in which people are assembling to voice their protest (which is often simply the demand for a decent life) are the ones under threat from capitalist regimes bent on privatizing public space, public goods and services, and on the violent enactment and enforcement of the private sphere... Like all of Butler&#x2019;s works, <i>Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly</i> is a heady immersion into the thought of one of today&#x2019;s most profound philosophers of action... This is a call for a truly transformative politics, and its relevance to the fraught struggles taking place in today&#x2019;s streets and public spaces around the world cannot be denied. For those seeking a way to reconcile the waves of refugees, the alternating violence and silence of the streets, and the democratic ideals many of us have been raised to hold, Butler offers if not a way then the beginnings of a coherent way to think about it. (Hans Rollman <i>PopMatters</i>)<br><br>One of the boldest and most radical thinkers of our time, Butler examines the contemporary state of popular sovereignty, resistance, and other &#x2018;concerted actions,&#x2019; as Hannah Arendt termed them, of political engagement in this series of essays expanding on her theory of performativity. Looking at recent mass protests, including events in Tahrir Square and the various Occupy movements, she explores what freedom of assembly entails in different spaces&#x2015;public, private, confined, and virtual&#x2015;while focusing on how individuals can take actual, not simply rhetorical, political action... Butler&#x2019;s examination of popular sovereignty and public assembly is incisive and exigent. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Judith Butler has written a vital, timely, and moving book that shines new light on the collective dimension of dissent. Instead of upholding the false division between thought and action, she recognizes that radical ideas are necessarily embodied. All over the world people are rising up and saying no to police violence, racial and gender discrimination, ecological devastation, austerity, and precarity. This powerful book is for anyone who has ever assembled with others to demand a more just and equal future. (Astra Taylor, author of <i>The People&#x2019;s Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age</i>)<br><br>In effect, Butler has written a manifesto against the privatization and individuation of political cultures. Butler&#x2019;s elegant and detailed philosophical reflections engage seriously and deeply with the writing of Arendt and some of the debates around humanity and social and political ontology that her work has generated. This is a profound and brief but very ambitious book. It is challenging but not dense, as lucid as it is timely. (Paul Gilroy, author of <i>Darker than Blue: On the Moral Economies of Black Atlantic Culture</i>)<br><br>Judith Butler wonderfully analyzes the power and promise of assembly, particularly the assembly of precarious populations, and in doing so offers a lucid and exciting analysis of contemporary forms of activism. This is a thinker at the height of her intellectual powers. (Michael Hardt, co-author of <i>Commonwealth</i>)<br><br>The book&#x2019;s novelty lies in its relatively substantive version of radical democracy. (A. L. Shuster <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>A work that stands out as perhaps Butler&#x2019;s most concerted attempt to make sense of constructive human agency...<i>Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly</i> is nonetheless Butler&#x2019;s most lucid and successful attempt to show that her views need not lead to &#x2018;quietism and retreat,&#x2019; and that they have always contained the seeds of a rich and important, positive contribution to political thought. Unlike some of her earlier works, this book is genuinely accessible to the intelligent student of political life who is not steeped in the abstruse and difficult claims of contemporary literary theory and cultural studies...Ultimately, Butler&#x2019;s project in <i>Notes Toward a Performative Theory</i> is valuable not only for its potential to rehabilitate humanism, but also for the clarity with which it requires the reader to recognize the political importance of contemporary media&#x2015;perhaps especially social media&#x2015;for the ways they have altered ethical and political domains.

The psychology of human memory and cognition is fascinating, dealing with questions and ideas that are inherently interesting, such as how we think, reason, remember, and use language. Using a first person narrative, posing direct questions to the reader, and balancing classic research with cutting edge topics, the author draws in the reader and conveys the excitement of the field. Reflecting the increasing use of new technologies to study memory and cognition, Ashcraft and the new co-author, Gabriel Radvansky, continue to integrate sections on neurosciences within individual chapter topics.</p><p><p>Pearson&#x2019;s MySearchLab is the easiest way for students to master a writing or research project.&nbsp; In a recent student survey, the overwhelming majority of students are assigned writing and research projects, for which they would use research and citation tools if they were available to them.&nbsp; MySearchLab is a website available at no additional charge in a package with a Pearson textbook and is also available as a standalone product.</p><p><b>To the Student</b></p> <p> The psychology of human memory and cognition is fascinating, dealing with questions and ideas that are inherently interesting; how we think, reason, remember, and use language, to name just a few. When cognitive psychologists talk research at conventions, they are agitated, intense, and full of energy. In contrast to this enthusiasm, however, undergraduate texts often portray the field as dull, too concerned with the minutiae of experimental method and technical jargon and not concerned enough with the interesting issues. </p> <p> Without slighting the empirical foundation of the field, I have tried to capture some of the excitement of the area. All professors want their students to understand the material, of course, but I also want you to appreciate cognitive psychology as one of the most interesting and memorable topics of your student career. Several features of the book are designed to accomplish this. </p> <ul> <li>To engage your interest and understanding, examples of the main points are sprinkled throughout the text. Most of the chapters have a box that asks you to Prove It; it gives you a demonstration project that can be done quickly to illustrate the points being made in that chapter. Furthermore, several demonstrations per chapter are available on the book's Web site at <b>http://www.prenhall.com/ashcraft</b>. You can conduct most of these miniature experiments with only moderate effort and little or no equipment. These are some of the best ways to see memory and cognition in action.</li> <li>Mastering the terminology of a new field can be difficult. To help you with the jargon, critical terms are boldfaced in the text and defined immediately in italicized print. Each chapter's terms are listed at the end of the chapter, and the entire collection of terms and definitions appears in the Glossary at the end of the book. Try studying for exams by playing a Jeopardy-like game with the glossary; one person reads a definition, the other names the defined term.</li> <li>Each major section of a chapter ends with a brief Section Summary. This along with the listing of glossary terms at the end of each chapter should help you check your understanding and memory as you study. Note that some people find it helpful to read the Section Summaries first as a preview of the section's content.</li> <li>The Web site also has Suggested Readings, articles and books that can help you pursue a particular topic. These are updated periodically, so check back occasionally to see what's new.</li> <li>I have intentionally used a more colloquial style than is customary in the field (or in texts in general), using the first person, posing direct questions to the reader, inserting parenthetical commentary, and so on. My students have told me that these features make the book more enjoyable to read; one said "it's interesting&#x2014;not like a textbook," which I took as a compliment. Some professors may expect a more formal, detached style, of course. I would rather have you read and remember the material than have you cope with a book selected because of a carefully pedantic style. Besides, you will have plenty of time to deal with boring books in graduate school.</li> </ul> <p><b>To the Instructor</b></p> <p> Like the first two editions, this edition is directed primarily toward undergraduates at the junior and senior level, who are probably taking their first basic course in memory and cognition. It has also been used successfully in introductory graduate surveys, especially when first-year students need a more thorough background in memory and cognition. </p> <p> There is much continuity between the second edition of <i>Human Memory and Cognition</i> and this edition, now titled simply <i>Cognition:</i> The foundation areas in cognition are still covered thoroughly, as you'll see in the Table of Contents. But this revision has several new features that you'll want to note. </p> <ul> <li>Since the second edition of this book was published in 1994, there has been a tremendous increase in the study of memory and cognition with the technologies and perspectives of cognitive neuroscience, or neurocognition, as I often call it. To reflect the centrality of those approaches to the topic, the book no longer segregates the neurocognitive evidence in a separate chapter. Instead, this edition integrates that material throughout the book. A major section of Chapter 2 provides background information on neurons and the brain, so even students without formal coursework on the biological basis of cognition will be prepared for the neurocognitive evidence they'll encounter throughout the book.</li> <li>There has been a thorough updating of the book, adding important new topics and developments that are central to the field, such as false memory research, the rapidly expanding research on working memory's influences, new research on the varieties of attention, and new strides in online investigations of comprehension and reading. There has also been some careful pruning of topics and streamlining of presentation.</li> <li>As in the first two editions, I have tried to strike a balance between basic, core material and cutting-edge topics. As cognitive psychology continues to evolve, it is important to maintain some continuity with older topics and evidence. Students need to understand how we got here, and instructors cannot be expected to start from scratch each time they teach the course. But revising the book continues to be a very revealing exercise in how cognitive psychology has changed in the past few years.</li> <li>In a variety of ways, this edition uses Web-based resources for professors and students alike. Each chapter includes Web-based activities, denoted by the CW symbol in the margins. Students will find demonstrations and exercises on the book's Web page (<b>http://www.prenhall.com/ashcraft</b>), along with Suggested Readings. Where possible, I note which readings are appropriate for undergraduates and which are too difficult for students at that level. The <i>Instructor's Manual</i> is also heavily Web-based; the Web pages include graphs and illustrations from the book that can be downloaded or printed onto transparencies. A test item file also is available via the Web; make sure your Prentice Hall sales representative gives you the necessary information to take advantage of these e-resources.</li> </ul> <p> I hope that the balance between classic research and current topics, the style I have adopted, and the standard organization I have used will make the text easy to teach from and easy for students to read and remember. More important, I hope that you will find my portrayal of the field of cognitive psychology useful. As always, I am delighted to receive the comments and suggestions of those who use this book, instructors and students alike.

Principles of modern physics are integrated throughout and, when appropriate, modern physics topics are intertwined with classic principles to allow students to develop intuition for and appreciation of this material as early as possible. Calculus and other mathematical tools are self-contained and become progressively more difficult; students learn the maths as they need to know it. Optional, stand alone sections provide detailed coverage of more subtle points; offer real-world models to explain technical concepts; and set off particularly detailed derivations of important equations. Student-oriented pedagogy helps put theory into practice, with worked examples, end-of-chapter problems, problem-solving boxes, together with hints and strategies in margin notes.</p><p>Fishbane/Gasiorowicz/Thornton is a comprehensive introduction to calculus- based physics. The most successful first-edition physics text of the last decade, it is the only book written specifically to address the main issue in this course--namely, balancing the needs and wants of the students with those of the instructor. The authors, experienced researchers and teachers, represent both theoretical and experimental physicists. This text presents balance between theory and applications, between concepts and problem-solving, between mathematics and physics, and finally, between technology and traditional pedagogical methods. Appropriate for both scientists and engineers with increased applications for engineering students.Designed to give readers a solid foundation in the core science of all science and technology, this book clearly explains and illustrates the principles of physics, their relations, and their applications. The book covers the modern notions of physics from the beginning, including the essential aspects of classical physics; explores spatial relativity and quantum mechanics; provides problem-solving techniques that offer new ways of looking at various problems in physics; helps readers develop the ability to effectively estimate; and more. The Interactive Physics Player, Macintosh/Windows-based software that recreates selected problems from the book, is available for an additional fee. Suitable for prospective engineers, scientists, doctors, and others who use technology in their careers.</p><h2>Glencoe World History, World History in Graphic Novel (WORLD HISTORY (HS))</h2><p>A graphic novel on World History</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A&nbsp;house of wonders itself. . . .&nbsp;<i>Wonderland&nbsp;</i>inspires grins and well-what-d'ya-knows&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>From the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&#x2013;</i>bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>How We Got to Now&nbsp;</i>and <i>Farsighted, </i>a look at&nbsp;the world-changing innovations we made while keeping ourselves entertained.<br> </b><br> This lushly illustrated history of popular entertainment takes a&nbsp;long-zoom approach, contending that the pursuit of novelty and wonder is a powerful driver of world-shaping technological change.

To the untrained eye, the murex snail, as it is also called, looks like an ordinary mollusk, housed in a conical shell ringed by bands of spikes. Millions of years ago, the snail evolved a kind of bioweapon used to sedate prey and defend itself against predators: an inky secretion that contains a rare compound called dibromoindigo. Almost four thousand years ago, the Minoan civilization based in the Aegean islands discovered that the murex snail secretion could&nbsp;be used as a dye to create one of the rarest of shades: the color purple.<br><br>Over time, the purple dye took on the name of a town in southern Phoenicia, Tyre, where it was mass-produced. The exact procedure for manufacturing Tyrian purple is unknown today, although Pliny the Elder included a fragmentary recipe in his <i>Natural History</i>. Modern attempts to re-create the dye suggest that more than ten thousand snails were required to produce just one gram of Tyrian dye. But if the production techniques remain a mystery, the historical record is clear about one thing: Tyrian purple endured as a symbol of status and affluence for at least a thousand years. Bands of Tyrian purple were woven into the tunics of Roman senators; a child conceived by one of the emperors of Byzantium was given the honorific <i>Porphyrogenitus&#x2014;</i>literally, &#x201c;born in the purple.&#x201d; Over the millennium that passed from the age of the Phoenicians to the fall of Rome, an ounce of Tyrian purple dye was worth significantly more than an ounce of gold, a valuation that compelled sailors to explore the entire coastline of the Mediterranean for colonies of murex snails.<br><br>Eventually, though, the supply of <i>Hexaplex trunculus </i>in the Mediterranean could not keep up with the demand for Tyrian purple, and a few intrepid Phoenician sailors began to contemplate more ambitious voyages in search of the mollusk, beyond the placid waters of the inland sea, out onto the gray, turbulent waves of the Atlantic itself. The Phoenicians had already passed through the Strait of Gibraltar in search of alluvial tin deposits, their distinctive cedar-planked ships, powered by thirteen oarsmen on each side, hugging the coast of Spain through waters that, technically speaking, belonged to the Atlantic. But it was the murex snail that compelled them to take on the towering waves and uncharted waters of the open ocean. They ventured down the coast of North Africa, where they eventually discovered a bounty of sea snails that would keep the aristocracy cloaked in purple well into the Dark Ages. The legacy of these voyages -extends far beyond simple fashion. The passage out of the Mediterranean into the vast mystery of the Atlantic marked a true threshold moment in the history of human exploration. &#x201c;The Phoenicians&#x2019; now-proven aptitude for sailing the North African coast was to be the key that unlocked the Atlantic for all time,&#x201d; Simon Winchester writes. &#x201c;The fear of the great unknown waters beyond the Pillars of Hercules swiftly dissipated.&#x201d; Think of all the ways the world would be transformed by vessels launched from Mediterranean countries, exploring the Atlantic and beyond. Those vessels would eventually leave in search of gold, or religious freedom, or military conquest. But the first siren song that lured them onto the open ocean was a simple color.<br><br>Garment design has driven technological innovation from the very beginning of human existence. Shears, sewing needles, and scrapers for converting animal skins into protective coverings for the body are among the oldest tools recovered from the Paleolithic age. To be sure, much of that innovation was utilitarian in nature. Ascots and hoop skirts aside, most clothing has some functional value, and certainly our ancestors fifty thousand years ago were making clothes with the explicit aim of keeping warm and dry and protected from potential threats. The fact that so much technological innovation&#x2014;from the first knitting needles to hand looms to the spinning jenny&#x2014;has emerged out of textile production can seem, at first glance, more a matter of necessity&#x2019;s invention. And yet the archeological record is replete with early examples of purely decorative toolmaking: a shell necklace discovered in the Sikul Cave in Israel was crafted more than a hundred thousand years ago. As soon as humans became toolmakers, they were making jewelry.<br><br>Whatever mix of playfulness and practicality drove early human garment design, the invention of Tyrian purple announced a fundamental shift toward delight and surprise&#x2014;a shift, in a sense, from function to fashion. No one <i>needs </i>the color purple. It does not protect you against malaria, or supply useful proteins, or reduce the chances that you will die in childbirth. It just looks nice, particularly if you live in a world where purple garments happen to be rare.<br><br>You might reasonably object at this point that those Phoenician snail wranglers&#x2014;and the oarsmen that first took them past the Strait of Gibraltar&#x2014;were motivated by financial gain, and not some sublime aesthetic response to purple itself. That is certainly the -canonical way of telling it. As soon as we invented liquid currencies, human beings were suddenly willing to take on improbably -ambitious and dangerous schemes if the price happened to be right. People left the&nbsp;safety of the Mediterranean because there was money in it&#x2014;a -motivation that was certainly powerful, but not particularly newsworthy.<br><br>A comparable argument might be made for the importance of status in the display of those purple garments. Humans evolved in hierarchical societies and most of us acknowledge that status-seeking is a common, if sometimes regrettable, driver of human behavior. The Phoenician aristocracy wanted to dye their clothes in shades of Tyrian purple so they could display their superiority over the commoners, and they were willing to pay for the privilege. Again, the causal chain is a familiar one: people will go to great lengths to satisfy&nbsp;the needs of the ruling elite if they are amply compensated for their labor. The fact that this labor involved harvesting thousands of snails&nbsp;may be an intriguing historical yarn, but does it really tell us&nbsp;anything new about the deep-seated forces that drive historical change?<br><br>With all due respect to Occam&#x2019;s razor, I think in this case the simpler story is not correct, or at least it fails to include the most interesting part of the explanation. The financial gain or status symbols were secondary effects; the initial fixation with purple was the prime mover. Take away the purely aesthetic response to the Tyrian dye, and the whole chain of exploration, invention, and profit falls apart. This turns out to be a recurring pattern in the history of play. Because delightful things are valuable, they often attract commercial -speculation, which funds and cultivates new technologies or markets or geographic exploration. When we look back at that process, we tend to talk about it in terms of the money and markets or the vanity of the ruling elite driving the new ideas. But the money has its own masters, and in many cases the dominant one is the human appetite for surprise and novelty and beauty. If you dig past the archeological layers of technological invention, profit motive, conquest, and -status--seeking, you will often find an unlikely stratum that lies beneath the more -familiar layers: the simple pleasure of a new experience&#x2014;in this case, the red and blue cones of our retinas registering a strange hybrid shade almost never found in nature. Somehow the story gets cast in the retelling as a tale of heroic inventors or efficient capital markets or brutal exploitation. That initial moment of delight becomes an afterthought, a footnote to the master narrative.<br><br>Nowhere is this oversight more glaring than in the story behind the greatest technological upheaval of modern times: the industrial revolution.<br><br>In the last few decades of the seventeenth century, a new pattern became visible&#x2014;arguably for the first time in history&#x2014;on the streets of a few select neighborhoods in London: St. James, Ludgate Hill, Bank Junction. A row of shops, each offering tantalizing collections of fabric, or jewelry, or home furnishings, clustered together on a few city blocks. The shopfronts featured large glass window displays, with merchandise arranged in visually arresting styles. The interiors were festooned with pillars, elaborate mirrors and lighting, sculpted cornices, and draperies. An observer from the early 1700s described them as &#x201c;perfectly gilded theaters.&#x201d;<br><br>All of this theatrical elegance was designed to create a new kind of aura around the simple act of buying goods. Earlier in the seventeenth century, shopping galleries like the New Exchange and Westminster Hall had created bustling, immersive spaces for commercial transactions, but the new shops added a measure of grandeur and elegance that made the galleries seem cramped and oppressive by comparison. In the exchanges, each vendor&#x2019;s space was small and largely unfurnished, closer to the stalls of a traveling fair or street peddlers. The new shops created a much more sumptuous environment, as though the consumer were entering the drawing room of a minor lord instead of bargaining with a street hawker. For the first time, the design of the shop became a part of the marketing message. Indeed, in an age that predates the modern craft of advertising, those shop designs were among the very first forms of marketing ever concocted. &#x201c;The seductive design of shops was intended to encourage customers to stay and to look around, to see shopping as a leisurely pursuit and an exciting experience,&#x201d; writes historian Claire Walsh. &#x201c;The more time a customer spent in the shop, the more attentively and persuasively they could be served, and in this sense the design of the shop was very much a part of the sales process.&#x201d; They made the act of shopping an end, and not just a means.<br><br>Some contemporary observers, mostly men, denounced the new shops as palaces of deception, designed to weave a spell over their customers. Describing the new fashionable shops in the resort town of Bath in the early 1700s, Abb� Pr�vost complained that they took advantage of &#x201c;a kind of enchantment which blinds everyone in these realms of enjoyment, to sell for their weight in gold trifles one is ashamed of having bought after leaving the place.&#x201d; In his 1727 survey of British commercial practice, <i>The Compleat English Tradesman</i>, Daniel Defoe devoted an entire chapter to the new practice of outfitting shops with such lavish trappings, a custom that appears to have baffled Defoe: &#x201c;It is a modern custom, and wholly unknown to our ancestors&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to have tradesmen lay out two-thirds of their fortune in fitting up their shops&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in painting and gilding, fine shelves, shutters, boxes, glass-doors, sashes, and the like,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;The first inference to be drawn from this must necessarily be, that this age must have more fools than the last: for certainly fools only are most taken with shows and outsides.&#x201d;<br><br>Defoe ultimately decided that there must be some kind of functional motive behind these seemingly excessive displays: &#x201c;Painting and adorning a shop seems to intimate, that the tradesman has a large stock to begin with; or else the world suggests he would not make such a show.&#x201d; Defoe&#x2019;s perplexity here is almost touching: you can see his mind working in overdrive to come up with a logical explanation for the frivolities of fine shelves and sashes. From our modern perspective, we can see clearly how the messaging embodied in the lavish shop decor obviously signaled more than just a large inventory; it created an envelope of luxury and high fashion that elevated the act of shopping itself into a form of entertainment. The consumers flocking to these new commercial spaces weren&#x2019;t just there for the goods they could purchase. They were there for the wonderland of the space itself.<br><br>Where shopping for clothes had previously been a straightforward, no-frills series of exchanges, bartering with street vendors or tradesmen&#x2014; -no different from buying eggs or milk&#x2014;now the practice of browsing and &#x201c;window shopping&#x201d; became its own sought-after experience. Before the rise of these lavish London shops, one went to market when one had something specific to purchase. Bazaars and open-air markets existed, of course, but they lacked the sumptuous displays of these new&nbsp;London shops. These &#x201c;perfectly gilded theaters&#x201d; transformed the&nbsp;journey of shopping into its own reward. A 1709 contributor to&nbsp;<i>Female Tatler </i>describes the phenomenon&#x2014;now ubiquitous in the&nbsp;developed world&#x2014;with fresh eyes: &#x201c;This afternoon some ladies, having an opinion of my fancy in cloaths, desired me to accompany them to Ludgate-hill, which I take to be as agreeable an amusement as&nbsp;a lady can pass away three or four hours in.&#x201d;<br><br>The language here&#x2014;&#x201c;agreeable amusements&#x201d;&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t fully do justice to the eventual magnitude of the transformation it was describing. It was a subtle shift, hard to notice if you weren&#x2019;t a proprietor of one of these shops, or a customer. To the untutored eye, those shops seemed like just a minor twist on the peddlers and tradesmen who had sold goods in the city for hundreds of years. In fact, the shift was so subtle that very few records were kept to document its existence. Like so many cultural revolutions that would follow, the modern experience of shopping trickled into the world as a minor subculture, enjoyed by a tiny fraction of the overall population, ignored by the mainstream&#x2014;until one day when the mainstream woke and found that it had been profoundly redirected by this strange new tributary. Every now and then, the creek floods the river.</p><h2>Protest: The Aesthetics of Resistance</h2><p><p><strong>Resistance: aesthetic tactics from the suffragettes to 1968 to our tumultuous present</strong></p><p>"Make Love Not War," "Soyez r�alistes, demandez l'impossible," "Keine Macht f�r Niemanden," "We are the 99%": the history of the last 50 years has been accompanied by a constant flow of statements, practices and declarations of dissatisfaction with regard to the prevailing order.</p><p>These slogans mark moments when dissent has been able to reach from the margins of society into its very center&#x2015;beginning as something mostly unorganized and unruly in real or virtual space, sometimes violent, rarely controllable and suddenly erupting into the mainstream.

The United States roundly opposed the move then, but two years later, Washington revived dreams for Palestinian statehood through bilateral diplomacy with Israel. But are the Palestinians prepared for the next step? In <i>State of Failure</i>, Middle East expert Jonathan Schanzer argues that the reasons behind Palestine's inertia are far more complex than we realize. Despite broad international support, Palestinian independence is stalling because of internal mismanagement, not necessarily because of Israeli intransigence. Drawing on exclusive sources, the author shows how the PLO under Yasser Arafat was ill prepared for the task of statebuilding. Arafat's successor, Mahmoud Abbas, used President George W. Bush's support to catapult himself into the presidency. But the aging leader, now four years past the end of his elected term, has not only failed to implement much needed reforms but huge sums of international aid continue to be squandered, and the Palestinian people stand to lose everything as a result. Supporters of Palestine and Israel alike will find Schanzer's narrative compelling at this critical juncture in Middle Eastern politics.</p></p><p>Jonathan Schanzer is the vice president for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and the author of <i>Hamas vs. Fatah</i>.

Yet many remained on active duty, becoming the &#x201c;after-army&#x201d; tasked with bringing order and justice to societies ravaged by war. Susan Carruthers shows how American soldiers struggled to deal with unprecedented catastrophe among millions of displaced refugees and concentration camp survivors while negotiating the inevitable tensions that arose between victors and the defeated enemy. Drawing on thousands of unpublished letters, diaries, and memoirs, she reveals the stories service personnel told themselves and their loved ones back home in order to make sense of their disorienting and challenging postwar mission.</p><p>The picture Carruthers paints is not the one most Americans recognize today. A venture undertaken by soldiers with little appetite for the task has crystallized, in the retelling, into the &#x201c;good occupation&#x201d; of national mythology: emblematic of the United States&#x2019; role as a bearer of democracy, progress, and prosperity. In real time, however, &#x201c;winning the peace&#x201d; proved a perilous business, fraught with temptation and hazard.</p></p><p>Susan L. Carruthers is Professor of History at Rutgers University&#x2013;Newark.A disturbing look at the experiences of the &#x2018;after-army&#x2019;: the American service-people who stayed on active duty after the Second World War, charged with rebuilding the places they had helped to destroy. Frank, often harsh voices from letters, diaries and memoirs serve up &#x2018;inconvenient truths&#x2019;: the armed forces&#x2019; caste system and racism; casual cruelty and venality trumping conscience; &#x2018;fraternisation&#x2019; (and prostitution and rape) with &#x2018;blowsy frauleins&#x2019; and &#x2018;anxious to please&#x2019; Japanese maids. (<i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>Based largely on previously unseen diaries and letters, the book poses the question: was the good war followed by the &#x2018;good occupation&#x2019; of the book&#x2019;s title? As ever, there is no easy answer and from Carruthers&#x2019;s lucid and elegantly written account, a picture emerges of muddled thinking and ill-thought out policies as often well-meaning men and women struggled with the conundrum that the people they were trying to help were representatives of countries they had only recently been attempting to destroy. (Trevor Royle <i>The Herald</i>)<br><br>With characteristic brilliance, Susan Carruthers has written a critical history of military victory.

In this lively, superbly researched account, we see not the magnanimous, square-jawed GIs and officers we recall today, but rather war-weary, bewildered Americans who confronted bombed-out cities and millions of hungry displaced people. To these very human occupiers, the successful rehabilitation of the enemy that we now celebrate appeared closer to Mission Impossible. (Sheldon Garon, author of <i>Molding Japanese Minds: The State in Everyday Life</i>)<br><br><i>The Good Occupation</i> dives directly into those controversies, mining a wide array of first-hand documents to create a vividly detailed picture of thousands of U.S. troops denied the neat conclusion to their wartime service that they dreamed about during the years of fighting. Carruthers doesn&#x2019;t shy away from the rapes, the looting, and the black market violence that cropped up in the Allied occupation as they have in every military occupation in the history of mankind. The venality of a significant number of U.S. occupiers (and their commanders&#x2015;General George Patton is quite dispassionately raked over the coals) is exposed in chapter after chapter of meticulous research and austerely lovely prose. (Steve Donoghue <i>Open Letters Monthly</i>)<br><br>[Carruthers&#x2019;s] book vividly illustrates the tumultuous period between 1945 and 1948, when Americans raised as isolationists suddenly found themselves in control of large swathes of the world and were ill-prepared to handle the mission at hand...Her archival research into the diaries and letters of the occupiers...lays bare the rapidly shifting attitudes that members of the Greatest Generation held toward the occupied, the military and America&#x2019;s new place in the world.

The loss of manufacturing jobs combined with the recession of the early 1980s and Reagan administration cutbacks in federal programs led to an explosion in the growth of food charity. This was meant to be a stopgap measure, but the jobs never came back, and the &#x201c;emergency food system&#x201d; became an industry. In <i>Big Hunger</i>, Andrew Fisher takes a critical look at the business of hunger and offers a new vision for the anti-hunger movement.</p><p>From one perspective, anti-hunger leaders have been extraordinarily effective. Food charity is embedded in American civil society, and federal food programs have remained intact while other anti-poverty programs have been eliminated or slashed. But anti-hunger advocates are missing an essential element of the problem: economic inequality driven by low wages. Reliant on corporate donations of food and money, anti-hunger organizations have failed to hold business accountable for offshoring jobs, cutting benefits, exploiting workers and rural communities, and resisting wage increases. They have become part of a &#x201c;hunger industrial complex&#x201d; that seems as self-perpetuating as the more famous military-industrial complex.</p><p>Fisher lays out a vision that encompasses a broader definition of hunger characterized by a focus on public health, economic justice, and economic democracy. He points to the work of numerous grassroots organizations that are leading the way in these fields as models for the rest of the anti-hunger sector. It is only through approaches like these that we can hope to end hunger, not just manage it.</p></p><p>Andrew Fisher has worked in the anti-hunger field for twenty-five years, as the executive director of national and local food groups, and as a researcher, organizer, policy advocate, and coalition builder. He has led successful efforts to gain passage of multiple pieces of federal food and nutrition legislation.<p>If you don't understand why anti-hunger groups hardly ever advocate for higher wages or public health nutrition measures for low-income Americans, see Andy Fisher's analysis: they owe too much to their food-company donors. <i>Big Hunger</i> is a call to action, one well worth heeding.</p>&#x2015;<b>Marion Nestle</b>, Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, New York University; author of <i>Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning)</i><br><br><p>In this groundbreaking work, Andy Fisher details America's approach to rising hunger, and lays bare a modern Orwellian irony: The big food companies whose labor practices have spurred hunger now receive credit&#x2015;tax, media, and otherwise&#x2015;for supporting charities to address it.

Through an entanglement of eyes-on-screens, ears-at-speakers, and muscles-against-interfaces, we experience games with our senses. But, as Brendan Keogh argues in <i>A Play of Bodies</i>, this corporal engagement goes both ways; as we touch the videogame, it touches back, augmenting the very senses with which we perceive. Keogh investigates this merging of actual and virtual bodies and worlds, asking how our embodied sense of perception constitutes, and becomes constituted by, the phenomenon of videogame play. In short, how do we perceive videogames?</p><p>Keogh works toward formulating a phenomenology of videogame experience, focusing on what happens in the embodied engagement between the playing body and the videogame, and anchoring his analysis in an eclectic series of games that range from mainstream to niche titles. Considering smartphone videogames, he proposes a notion of <i>co-attentiveness</i> to understand how players can feel present in a virtual world without forgetting that they are touching a screen in the actual world. He discusses the somatic basis of videogame play, whether games involve vigorous physical movement or quietly sitting on a couch with a controller; the sometimes overlooked visual and audible pleasures of videogame experience; and modes of temporality represented by character death, failure, and repetition. Finally, he considers two metaphorical characters: the &#x201c;hacker,&#x201d; representing the hegemonic, masculine gamers concerned with control and configuration; and the &#x201c;cyborg,&#x201d; less concerned with control than with embodiment and incorporation.</p></p><p>Brendan Keogh, Research Fellow in the School of Communication at Queensland University of Technology, is the author of <i>Killing Is Harmless: A Critical Reading of </i>Spec Ops: The Line.<p>This book challenges some of the dominant discourses of game studies in a way that is vital to the field right now.

In this textbook D. A. Cruse establishes in a principled and disciplined way the descriptive and generalizable facts about lexical relations that any formal theory of semantics will have to encompass. Among the topics covered in depth are idiomaticity, lexical ambiguity, synonymy, hierarchical relations such as hyponymy and meronymy, and various types of oppositeness. Syntagmatic relations are also treated in some detail. The discussions are richly illustrated by examples drawn almost entirely from English. Although a familiarity with traditional grammar is assumed, readers with no technical linguistic background will find the exposition always accessible. All readers with an interest in semantics will find in this original text not only essential background but a stimulating new perspective on the field.</p><p>Lexical Semantics is about the meaning of words.

This prose translation of the ancient poem offers a gripping account of the downfall of a royal house, the Burgundians, of Nibelungen.<br>Written by an unknown poet at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, this saga draws on legends from Scandinavian and German literature. The first half recounts the life and death of Sifrid (Siegfried), the dragon-slaying superman who possesses a magic treasure and whose matchless bravery and strength can only be undone through betrayal. In the second half, Sifrid's noble queen Kriemhilde carries out a year-long quest for vengeance, destroying not only thousands of her countrymen but all of her kinsmen as well. This fine translation will appeal to all lovers of epics and tales in the chivalric tradition, as well as to students of Germanic and Scandinavian literature.</p><p></p></p><p>Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Kovels&#39; Antiques and Collectibles Price Guide 2018</h2><p><b>The 50th edition of <i>Kovels'</i>, the leading antiques price guide, includes 20,000 listings and more than 2,500 full-color photographs.</b> <br><i>Kovels'</i> is the most complete and best-illustrated price guide available, from the most trusted name in the industry.

C. to Octavian's final defeat of Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium, has offered a rich and variegated field of exploration for historians, philosophers, economists, and literary critics. Yet few scholars have attempted the daunting task of seeing the period whole, of refracting its achievements and reception through the lens of a single critical mind. <i>Alexander to Actium</i> was conceived and written to fill that gap.<br><br>In this monumental work, Peter Green&#x2014;noted scholar, writer, and critic&#x2014;breaks with the traditional practice of dividing the Hellenistic world into discrete, repetitious studies of Seleucids, Ptolemies, Antigonids, and Attalids. He instead treats these successor kingdoms as a single, evolving, interrelated continuum. The result clarifies the political picture as never before. With the help of over 200 illustrations, Green surveys every significant aspect of Hellenistic cultural development, from mathematics to medicine, from philosophy to religion, from literature to the visual arts.<br><br>Green offers a particularly trenchant analysis of what has been seen as the conscious dissemination in the East of Hellenistic culture, and finds it largely a myth fueled by Victorian scholars seeking justification for a no longer morally respectable imperialism. His work leaves us with a final impression of the Hellenistic Age as a world with haunting and disturbing resemblances to our own. This lively, personal survey of a period as colorful as it is complex will fascinate the general reader no less than students and scholars.</p><p><b>Peter Green</b> is Dougherty Centennial Professor of Classics at the University of Texas at Austin. A novelist and translator as well as a scholar, he is the author of many books, including <i>The Laughter of Aphrodite: A Novel about Sappho of Lesbos</i> (California, 1993)."A welcome addition to the study of Hellenistic history, which has been notoriously overlooked. Green's text is supplied with the most complete indexing, chronologies, and genealogies that I have ever encountered in a history survey." -- <i>M. Johnston, The Classical Outlook</i><br><br>"Green's magisterial narrative history covers Hellenistic society as it has never been covered before, boldly combining political and military events with cultural and intellectual developments." -- <i>Robert Taylor, The Boston Globe</i><br><br>"Green's style is lively, he draws striking parallels with recent history and recent persons; he paces his narrative in a way that makes it very readable, while deftly keeping the reader aware of the whole of his large-scale patterning of these complex and ramified chains of events. He punctuates narrative with more general discussion, and he picks out telling details that illuminate and remain in the memory. His story line is crisp, and his interpretation is eminently clear and vividly conveyed." -- <i>Jasper Griffin, New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"This is a work long awaited and badly needed. The professional scholar will learn much from it; the teacher will find it an invaluable aid in awakening the interest of students in this neglected period; the common reader will be informed and fascinated by this magnificent account of a time so much more like our own than the better known periods that preceded and succeeded it." -- <i>Donald Kagan, Journal of Interdisciplinary History</i></p><h2>Swallow Safely.

Yet, as Fred Turner reveals in <i>The Democratic Surround</i>, the decades that brought us the Korean War and communist witch hunts also witnessed an extraordinary turn toward explicitly democratic, open, and inclusive ideas of communication and with them new, flexible models of social order. Surprisingly, he shows that it was this turn that brought us the revolutionary multimedia and wild-eyed individualism of the 1960s counterculture.<br>In this prequel to his celebrated book <i>From Counterculture to Cyberculture</i>, Turner rewrites the history of postwar America, showing how in the 1940s and &#x2019;50s American liberalism offered a far more radical social vision than we now remember. Turner tracks the influential mid-century entwining of Bauhaus aesthetics with American social science and psychology. From the Museum of Modern Art in New York to the New Bauhaus in Chicago and Black Mountain College in North Carolina, Turner shows how some of the most well-known artists and intellectuals of the forties developed new models of media, new theories of interpersonal and international collaboration, and new visions of an open, tolerant, and democratic self in direct contrast to the repression and conformity associated with the fascist and communist movements. He then shows how their work shaped some of the most significant media events of the Cold War, including Edward Steichen&#x2019;s <i>Family of Man</i> exhibition, the multimedia performances of John Cage, and, ultimately, the psychedelic Be-Ins of the sixties. Turner demonstrates that by the end of the 1950s this vision of the democratic self and the media built to promote it would actually become part of the mainstream, even shaping American propaganda efforts in Europe.<br>Overturning common misconceptions of these transformational years, <i>The Democratic Surround</i> shows just how much the artistic and social radicalism of the sixties owed to the liberal ideals of Cold War America, a democratic vision that still underlies our hopes for digital media today.<br></p><p><b>Fred Turner</b> is associate professor of communication at Stanford University.

M. Montgomery. &#x201c;The Alpine Path&#x201d; of the title refers to the long climb she had to achieve success as a writer. She began in childhood, and never wavered in her resolve. Her ambition was to become an accomplished professional writer&#x2014;she never desired fame or greatness, and the remarkable success that came to her with the publication of Anne of Green Gables. "When the Editor of Everywoman's World asked me to write "The Story of My Career," I smiled with a little touch of incredulous amusement. My career? Had I a career? Was not &#x2013; should not &#x2013; a "career" be something splendid, wonderful, spectacular at the very least, something varied and exciting? Could my long, uphill struggle, through many quiet, uneventful years, be termed a "career"? It had never occurred to me to call it so; and, on first thought, it did not seem to me that there was much to be said about that same long, monotonous struggle. But it appeared to be a whim of the aforesaid editor that I should say what little there was to be said; and in those same long years I acquired the habit of accommodating myself to the whims of editors to such an inveterate degree that I have not yet been able to shake it off.

The text is excellent, beginning with the fact that whales are air-breathing, warm-blooded mammals, and then outlining their variation in size and evolutionary history. Gibbons describes the two groups of whales--toothed and baleen--delineating their differences not only in physiology but also in behavior. Representative members of each group are pictured and given a one-or-two line description. Each drawing is labeled, and a helpful pronunciation guide accompanies difficult or unfamiliar words. Some of the illustrations, however, are overly cute and personified, with full, almost pouty, lower lips and facial expressions. The grinning belugas swimming around the blue whale are a little disconcerting. A one-page section called "Whale Tales" presents such factual tidbits as "A blue whale eats about 4,400 pounds of krill a day" and "A sperm whale can dive down more than a half mile."

Cohn tackles a timely issue that few children's books address. When young Daniel and his mother discover that Mr. James' grocery store has been robbed and Mr. James' arm broken, Daniel is angry and worried. Daniel's father explains why people steal (some don't know the difference between right and wrong, some were abused as children and are angry at the world, some use drugs and alcohol, which affects their actions) and offers positive outlets for expressing emotions. Daniel pounds his punching bag to show how he feels about poor Mr. James. When Daniel has a nightmare, his parents comfort him. Although not ready to return to the store, Daniel draws a picture for Mr. James. Later when Daniel and a friend play a robbery game in which one child "shoots" the other, Daniel's parents suggest the boys think of other, more appropriate choices for solving that confrontation. A classroom scene in which Daniel's teacher discusses feelings, and a reassuring visit from Mr. James, who tells Daniel about the preventive measures he has taken in his store and the wealth of goodwill he has felt since the robbery, round out the book. Although the text is a bit stilted, the rich color drawings, against golden backgrounds, provide a warm setting for the complex problem. A detailed note in the front, examining the emotional issues of violence and children, with specific strategies for helping youngsters, is a plus. Recommended as a first step toward dealing positively with an explosive and devastating topic. <i>Deborah Abbott</i>This earnest story by the psychotherapist who wrote I Had a Friend Named Peter: Talking to Children About the Death of a Friend (1987) is not really about why Daniel's friend Mr. James gets a broken arm when his store is robbed. Although Daniel's father offers some generalized answers (e.g., ``Some people have a special kind of problem that makes it hard for them to know right from wrong''), the question is more a classic cry against injustice. It's about the feelings aroused in a child when violence touches someone close and how they can best be addressed. Daniel's parents find out the real facts, encourage verbal and nonverbal expression of his feelings, and provide a punching ball for him to vent his anger; when he dramatizes capturing the robber, he's encouraged to find an alternative to guns, even in play; when Daniel is reluctant to return to the store, Mr. James reassures him with a home visit; and so on. The thorough explication, extended even further in a sensible five- page introduction, is heavy-handed for a story, but Cohn carries it off in a smooth telling that's nicely enhanced by empathetic full-bleed art rendered in warm, rather sober hues. For a more imaginative (yet equally serious) treatment of the impact of violence on children, see Eve Bunting's Smoky Night (p. 300).

It integrates concepts of age, setting, role development, and ethical/legal issues. Users gain a simulated experience in prioritizing nursing problems, identifying appropriate teaching strategies, documenting nursing care, and critically analyzing the totality of common situations encountered in professional nursing practice. <b> </b> Unfolding case models deal with obstetrics, pediatrics, mental health, medical surgery, and assorted cases regarding such issues as: falls in the elderly, urinary incontinence, aging, sleep-rest changes, managing staff conflict, public health nursing, vital signs, confidentiality, and spirituality. <b> </b> For educating student and staff nurses in various nursing programs. </p></p><p>Preface To the Student <p> The purpose of this workbook is to help you practice the critical skills of problem solving and applying information to common situations you encounter in your practice of professional nursing. The role of the professional nurse has become exceedingly more complex, as nurses must care for clients in shorter time periods and in a variety of settings such as home, hospital, outpatient clinics, and rehabilitation facilities. No longer do nurses have extended periods of time to process information and plan care. As insurance plans dictate shorter stays and/or fewer visits, nurses must be able to analyze situations, plan interventions, and respond quickly to ever-changing situations. </p><p> The "Unfolding Cases Model" (Glendon and Ulrich, 1997) will give you practice in the skills you will need in the workplace. You will be asked to analyze realistic cases that unfold sequentially and follow the typical progression of common conditions or disorders. All cases are interspersed with focused questions to be answered by groups of students using common cooperative learning strategies (see Table 1). By using the case as a study guide prior to class, you will have some time to explore these focused questions individually, prior to your group involvement. This prior preparation will increase the effectiveness of the group strategy. Your instructor will brief you about the strategy she or he wishes you to use, as well as the process of how to report your group's findings to the entire class. An important aspect of learning and using critical thinking is being able to examine the varied perspectives of others. This cooperative learning group strategy exposes you to the alternative ideas and ways of thinking of your peers, thus multiplying the learning potential of the case. At the end of each case you will be asked to complete a reflective writing assignment that will allow you to investigate your individual thoughts, feelings, and ideas related to nursing practice issues or situations (see Table 2). In nursing practice we are frequently exposed to situations that oppose our personal values and beliefs. These cases will give you an opportunity to explore these issues and help you identify the nursing role. Your instructor may collect the cases prior to class discussion to determine your level of preparation for discussion of the case. In any instance, prior individual preparation will benefit both you and your group as you process the case in class. </p><p> This book is designed to help you adapt to the new ways your instructors will be teaching in the new millennium. Research has shown that students learn best when they are actively involved in the process of learning and are not passive recipients of the teacher's expertise. You will notice that your instructors are using the lecture method less often and are relying on newer interactive group strategies. This can be very disturbing to you as a student who is used to previous methods that required you to merely take notes on what the instructor presented and regurgitate the same information back to them on a test. Now, in this model, the instructor poses a case and asks you and your peers to process it. They won't be just giving you the right answers. Your first impulse might be to think your instructor is not doing anything and that you are teaching yourself. This is a common feeling, but it is far from the truth. The instructor is merely changing his or her role in the teaching and learning process from being the center of knowledge to being one of manipulating the environment so that students can be involved in and discover the connections of things in an active fashion. Being actively involved will increase your learning. In the traditional lecture method, students quickly learn that it is not really necessary to read or prepare much prior to class because the teacher will tell them in the lecture everything that is really important. This way of thinking is erroneous in that today's world is filled with volumes of ever-changing information and no one could possibly know everything. Therefore, the most important job of the teacher is to create focus and teach you how to think. Information will change, but the skill of problem solving and critical thinking will benefit you forever. That is the purpose of this "Unfolding Case Model." (Glendon and Ulrich, 1997) </p><p> In traditional methods, the majority of time you spend with the teacher is when she or he is presenting you with new information in a lecture. Until you have had the time to process that information, you are unaware of what you do not understand or what questions you have. It is when you are alone reviewing your notes and trying to process and apply information that you really need the teacher's help. In the new learning paradigm, students need to prepare individually by doing the reading assignments and/or looking at the case prior to class. Class time should be the time when the instructor helps students process information that they have already been exposed to through their own reading. The "Unfolding Case" method actualizes this line of thinking. In using this book, you need to read through the case before doing your reading assignment to help you emphasize the important content in the reading. As you read, jot down possible solutions to each of the focused questions. This~will help you as you interact with your peers to process the case in class. Your instructor will tell you which cooperative learning strategies to use and how to report your findings as a group. He or she may also use this same model at the end of a clinical for a post conference or as a clinical make-up assignment. As you complete the cases, it is our hope that you will work with your instructor and expand your ability to learn and grow as a professional.</p><p>Sincerely,<br><br> Kellie Glendon and Debbie Ulrich</p><p> <b> <b>Unfolding Case Studies: Experiencing the Realities of Clinical Nursing Practice</b> </b> </p><ul> <li>Kellie J.

They support the livelihoods of a substantial proportion of the world's population and are the source of many internationally traded commodities. They remain (despite decades of conservation attention) increasingly vulnerable to degradation and clearance, with profound though often uncertain future costs to global society. Understanding the ecology of these diverse biomes, and peoples' dependencies on them, is fundamental to their future management and conservation. <br><br><em>Tropical Rain Forest Ecology, Diversity, and Conservation</em> introduces and explores what rain forests are, how they arose, what they contain, how they function, and how humans use and impact them. The book starts by introducing the variety of rain forest plants, fungi, microorganisms, and animals, emphasising the spectacular diversity that is the motivation for their conservation. The central chapters describe the origins of rain forest communities, the variety of rain forest formations, and their ecology and dynamics. The challenge of explaining the species richness of rain forest communities lies at the heart of ecological theory, and forms a common theme throughout. The book's final section considers historical and current interactions of humans and rain forests. It explores biodiversity conservation as well as livelihood security for the many communities that are dependent on rain forests - inextricable issues that represent urgent priorities for scientists, conservationists, and policy makers.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jaboury Ghazoul</strong>'s first encounter with tropical rain forests in 1993 was a prolonged one, spending one year living rough in the forests of Vietnam where his scientific subjects were disturbingly close. It was during this year that he learnt to distinguish the sound of a chainsaw from the call of a cicada. Imbued with such knowledge and confidence, he began to study the reproductive ecology of plants in the context of land use change, working in Thailand and Costa Rica, employed by the Center for International Forestry Research and the Natural History Museum, London. Since joining Imperial College London in 1998, and ETH Zurich from 2005, he has expanded his research interests to encompass a variety of issues relating to tropical plant ecology, genetics and conservation. He generally selects nice places to work, and is thus currently engaged in research in India, Malaysia and the Seychelles. <br><br><strong>Douglas Sheil</strong> spent the first three years of his life in Nigeria. He returned to the tropics several times as a Natural Sciences student in Cambridge, before gaining a Masters Degree in Forestry and its relation to Land use from Oxford in 1989. He worked in East Africa for two years before returning to Oxford to complete his doctorate examining long-term dynamics of Ugandan rainforests in 1996. From 1998 to 2008 he worked for the Center for International Forest Research in Indonesia - where he was for a time the only staff ecologist. His work has taken him to all the main rain forest regions of the World. He is now director of the Institute of Tropical Forest Conservation (ITFC), a field station under the Mbarara University of Science and Technology, located in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, in South West Uganda - a site famed for its mountain gorillas. His publications have covered a wide range of tropical forest topics.

The catalogue for an exhibition that received wide acclaim at the Musee d&#39;Orsay, Paris, and that opens at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, in June 1998, this handsome book presents 80 of Hammershoi&#39;s distinctive and intimate portraits, landscapes, and interiors.Hammershoi exhibited extensively throughout Europe and was recognized by his peers as the premier Danish painter; critics often included him among the French Impressionists. His reputation diminished after his death, however, and he remained relatively unknown until his recent rediscovery.Today&#39;s art lovers will immediately respond to Hammershoi&#39;s extraordinary use of line, light, and shadow, and to his interiors and landscapes punctuated with a mood of concentrated absence. His portraits, too, are compelling psychological studies, often reflecting the isolation of the long Scandinavian winter. This book restores Hammershoi&#39;s rightful place in the history of art.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Danish</p><h2>Historical Linguistics: An Introduction</h2><p><p>This accessible, hands-on text not only introduces students to the important topics in historical linguistics but also shows them how to apply the methods described and how to think about the issues; abundant examples and exercises allow students to focus on how to do historical linguistics. Distinctive to this text is its integration of the standard topics with others now considered important to the field, including syntactic change, grammaticalization, sociolinguistic contributions to linguistic change, distant genetic relationships, areal linguistics, and linguistic prehistory. Examples are taken from a broad range of languages; those from the more familiar English, French, German, and Spanish make the topics more accessible, while those from non-Indo-European languages show the depth and range of the concepts they illustrate.This second edition features expanded explanations and examples as well as updates in light of recent work in linguistics, including a defense of the family tree model, a response to recent claims on lexical diffusion/frequency, and a section on why languages diversify and spread.</p></p><p>Lyle Campbell is Professor of Linguistics at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa.

Developed by Byron P.

Now, for the first time, evidence that bears upon the white matter model has been gathered into a single volume.

The diseases and disorders discussed include callosal agenesis, Asperger syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, Williams syndrome, de Lange syndrome, early hydrocephalus, Sotos syndrome, congenital hypothyroidism, acute lymphocytic leukemia, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Turner syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and toxicant-induced encephalopathy. Dimensions relevant to both assessment and treatment are raised throughout the work, as are suggestions for future research.<br>Recommended for neuropsychologists, neurologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and pediatricians treating children with learning disabilities or with pediatric neurological disease, disorder, and dysfunction, <i>Syndrome of Nonverbal Learning Disabilities</i> serves both as an authoritative update on recent advances and as a text for advanced courses in child/developmental neuropsychology, pediatric neurology, and learning disabilities. <br></p><p>Byron P.

Her daughter says, &#34;I learned from her that precision requires a warm eye, not a cold one,&#34; and so did we all. Keen wit and real modesty seldom occur in such happy alliance. Who she was is what she writes. She never shows off, never bullies. She asks us what do you think about this? and is interested in our answer. She takes nothing for granted and everything as worth rethinking. Her writing on social issues remains timely because it was never superficial; she held understanding more useful than judgment. Very few writers can match the offhand voice, with its unmistakable oral cadence, in which her poignant, funny short stories are told. * Ursula K. Le Guin * Grace Paley&#39;s work makes the novel as a form seem virtually redundant. Each one of her stories has more abundant inner life than most other people&#39;s novels . . . Her prose presents a series of miracles of poetic compression * Angela Carter * Grace Paley is one of the great writers of voice of the last century. There&#39;s an experience one has reading a stylist like her that has to do with how rich in truth the phrase-or-sentence-level bursts are and how quickly they follow upon one another ... A writer like Paley comes along and brightens language up again, takes it aside and gives it a pep talk, sends it back renewed, so it can do its job, which is to wake us up * George Saunders * These stories, brief and extended, burn with a high-energy commitment to the great work of being alive. They are stories full of the stories we all tell and live by, tall stories as well as short . . . And they are stories in which the whole of a world, its children, its dead, its furniture, its snacks, is lovingly and unsentimentally named. Named, and not forgiven. * Salman Rushdie * Grace Paley makes me weep and laugh - and admire. She is that rare kind of writer, a natural, with a voice like no one else&#39;s: funny, sad, lean, modest, energetic, acute * Susan Sontag * An understanding of loneliness, lust, selfishness and fatigue that is splendidly comic and unladylike * Philip Roth * This is a collection full of energy and stunning, quiet innovation ... it spills over with contempt, raucous humour, sadness and generosity. In it, life and language are synonymous, and there is no higher praise. What a wonderful book -- Ali Smith Paley is as clever a mimic as Philip Roth, as cheerfully zany and aleatory in her vision of New York as Christina Stead, as serendipitous as Donald Bartheleme, but her unladylike gutsiness and friendliness are nonpareil -- Edmund White * Observer *</p><h2>Southern Living Garden Problem Solver</h2><p>Examines some of the most common garden pests and plant diseases found in Southern gardens, and offers advice on damage control</p><p></p><h2>The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology</h2><p>Providing an authoritative and comprehensive overview of the classical and the contemporary, this volume is an indispensable guide to the vibrant and expanding field of sociology.

Over the course of six decades, Davis produced artworks that drew inspiration from the European modernists but were deeply rooted in the popular culture of the United States. Jazz music and hipster talk, vaudeville stages, city streetscapes, New England fishing villages, gasoline stations, store fronts, and commercial packaging and advertising images were among the sources that infused his art with energy, bringing crisp edges, radiant color, and syncopated rhythms to a vast body of paintings, watercolors, and drawings.</p><p>Documenting the life&#x2019;s work of this prolific and highly influential artist&#x2014;who affected almost every development in American art from second-generation Ashcan realism around 1912 to color field and geometric painting in the 1960s&#x2014;is a monumental achievement. In these three volumes, the editors have catalogued 1,749 artworks by the artist&#x2014;including more than 600 works never previously illustrated&#x2014;providing extensive documentation and information about each one.
